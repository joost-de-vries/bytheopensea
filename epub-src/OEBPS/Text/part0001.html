      <h1 id="c07h01">CHAPTER VII</h1>

      <p>Half an hour later the Superintendent of Fisheries had embarked with the little party in their sailing boat which took his own small craft in tow. He had assumed the position of escort to the two ladies who, seeking health, had decided to spend the summer on the skerry, and were therefore going to be his neighbours.</p>

      <p>A pleasant conversation was soon afloat, and the three new acquaintances kept the ball rolling with that somewhat breathless zeal which the desire to show oflE their accomplishments and finest qualities frequently kindles in people who meet for the first time.</p>

      <p>The old lady who had introduced herself as the mother of the pretty girl was the least excited of the three. She seemed to have attained to complete harmony and resignation, to have rubbed oflE all comers, and to be living in the past. She regarded everything which happened around her with a feeling akin to indifference; expected nothing from outside, was prepared for anything good or bad which life might still hold in store for her, and</p>

      <p>inspired a feeling of liking in all whom she met by her even temperament and gentleness.</p>

      <p>A contact had already established itself between the young man and the girl; she appeared to find delight in accepting and he, who had long waited for the happiness of being allowed to give, felt his strength growing as he found an outlet for the surplus knowledge which had been accumulating for so many years. With spendthrift hands he gave his new friends in half an hour a mass of information which he thought might be of use to them. They were unacquainted with the environment in which they proposed living for a time. He described to them all the advantages and disadvantages of the island, painting life on the -skerry in the glowing colours in which he saw it now that he was no longer alone.</p>

      <p>The girl, who had never seen the skerry, received her first definite impressions from his description. In imagination she beheld the red cottage in which she and her mother were to live in the entrancing light in which he intended her to see it, in order to make her like it and induce her to stay.</p>

      <p>While he was speaking he was conscious of an influx of strength and goodness; her half-open lips seemed to utter new ideas, new points of view; they did not merely seem to breathe in what he gave out, but give back thought for</p>

      <p>thought. As those two innocent eyes looked into his in admiration and astonishment, he believed that every word he said was true; he felt, with growing self-respect, new powers being bom in his soul, and old ones increasing in strength and steadfastness.</p>

      <p>He was genuinely grateful as they landed, like a man who has been helped at a time of distress. He spontaneously thanked the ladies as he assisted them out of the boat and carried their heavy portmanteaus ashore.</p>

      <p>The girl replied to his courteous words with a smiling 'Don't mention it,* as if she had given him a trifle compared to the treasures which she still had to bestow.</p>

      <p>As the three arrived at their destination which proved to be Oeman's cottage, the girl, still under the spell of Borg*s alluring description, burst into a flood of rapturous words. And there really was something unusually picturesque in the appearance of the dilapidated little house. It did not boast one single straight line. Gales, salt-water, rain and frost had destroyed all sharp contours, and since the cement had crumbled away, the chimney looked like a great tufE.</p>

      <p>A still more pleasant surprise was the really cosy, old-fashioned comfort of the interior. The two rooms were situated on either side of the passage; between them lay the kitchen.</p>

      <p>The walls of the big room were hung with a dark brown paper, mellowed by age and smoke to one single, pleasant tone which harmonised with all colours. The low ceiling, instead of consisting of a large, empty space, which fancy might people with all sorts of shapes, showed the beams which supported the loft. Two small windows, with tarnished window panes, a quarter of a square yard in size, gave a view of sea and harbour. The brilliant day-light was pleasantly subdued by white curtains which warded off curious glances without darkening the room; like fleecy summer clouds they flowed down on balsam and geraniums which grew in English china pots, adorned by the portraits of Queen Victoria and Lord Nelson in green and yellow.</p>

      <p>The furniture consisted of a big, white folding-table, a Gustavian bed with several layers of swelling eider down bedding, a wooden sofa painted white, a Swedish clock, a chest of drawers made of birch wood, and a dressing table of alder roots, swathed with a bridal veil and covered with china. A stuffed parrot under a glass shade stood on the chest of drawers. The walls were covered with lithographs representing scenes from the Old Testament; two of these, which were hanging over the bed, owed their existence to a not very lofty sentiment; one of them portrayed Samson</p>

      <p>and Delilah in a very compiiomising attitude, and the other represented Joseph and Poti-phar's wife. A huge fire-place took up the whole of one comer of the room; the effect would have been ghostly if the black opening had not been concealed by a white curtain running on a tape.</p>

      <p>The impression created by the whole was one of cosinessi cleanliness and sweet simplicity.</p>

      <p>The other room, which resembled the first one, had two beds, a washing stand, and two or three strips of floor carpet, made of many pieces which, with their varied colours, formed a kind of album of mementoes : of grandfather's coat, grandmother's jacket, mother's cotton dress, father's uniform dating from his pilot days; the girls' red garters, the yellow military braids of the boys, the blue bathing costumes of the summer guests; pilot cloth and Manchester cotton and baize, wool and jute, specimens of many fashions and wardrobes, of the poor as well as the rich.</p>

      <p>Pushed against one of the walls stood a large dresser made of white deal, with painted doors whose panels were wonderful little landscapes framed in ivy-shoots of inlaid bronze, depicting cornflower blue bays, banks grown over with rushes, sailing boats and trees of unknown species, indigenous to Paradise or the Car-</p>

      <p>\V Digitized by Google</p>

      <p>boniferous Period; a rough sea with waves as straight as the furrows in a potato field; a lighthouse which stood like a column on a cliff composed of stone step's; and all these things were represented with the simplicity and naivet6 with which the crude eye of a child beholds the infinite wealth and variety of nature only fully apparent to a. highly trained eye.</p>

      <p>But it was just this old-fashioned simplicity which was to cure the tired brain come here to find rest in association with the past. The worn-out clockwork was to remain imwound, the spring relaxed, till such time as the lost energy should be restored. Association with the lower classes, who were not competitors in the struggle for supremacy, but involuntarily reminded the upper classes daily and hourly of their hard-earned point of vantage, should relax the tension, and lull the ambitious heart with the thought that there were stages which it had long left behind.</p>

      <p>Axel Borg had prepared the senses of the visitors, so that they should be able to see and feel all this. The two ladies consequently never wearied of reiterating their satisfaction with their new quarters, and became so absorbed in their investigations that neither of them noticed the quiet withdrawal of their escort.</p>

      <p>In the afternoon Axel Borg sat at his window and watched his new neighbours settling down in their cottage. As his eyes followed their graceful, irregular movements, he seemed to hear music. The same undulations which the successive repetition of a single note produces on the drum of the ear and transmits to the nervous system, th^ same gentle vibrations were set in motion now by the eye, and made to sound through the white strings which are stretched from the scroll of the cranium across the sounding board of the chest, and carry the trembling pulses to the very depth of the soul. A feeling of general well-being flowed through him as he watched the rounded movements of those delicate white hands, taking odds and ends from the portmanteaus and depositing them on table and chairs, noticed the elastic rise and fall of hips and shoulders, unappreci-able, perhaps, to a coarser eye. There was never a straight line as the girl glided through the room, no sharp comers as she turned round, no angles as she stooped down.</p>

      <p>He was so fascinated by the spectacle that a slight noise in the loft, the creaking of the stairs and the turning of a key in the lock completely escaped his notice for the moment.</p>

      <p>He was gazing at the girl whose beauty, with the exception of one point, seemed to him to have reached absolute perfection. He</p>

      <p>wanted to accustom his eye to the one defect, so as not to see it any longer. Her chin was a little too large, indicating a lower jaw which was unnecessarily well developed for a human being who no longer seized, held and tore raw flesh. Whenever he saw her profile, his imagination involuntarily constructed from it the physiognomy of a witch, which doubtless was the fate of the lovely face when, in old age, the teeth would drop out, the lips fall in, forming an obtuse angle, and the nose sink down to meet the protruding chin. He must force himself to overcome this haunting suggestion of a beast of prey; his eyes were rivetted on her features; he re-constructed them in imagination and forced himself to look at her face in its entirety.</p>

      <p>All of a sudden he heard foot-steps and wild screams in the street before the house. Oeman's wife and a horde of frantic women were triumphantly carrying the recovered draw net down to the drying poles.</p>

      <p>It was a slap in his face; he put on his hat and went downstairs to look for the inspector; he would call on him, the paid servant of the Government, for the assistance which he was entitled to claim.</p>

      <p>The inspector was sitting at the table, drinking coffee, with his arm, as usual, round his sister-in-law, for Vestman was away, fish-</p>

      <p>byGoogle^^^^</p>

      <p>ing. As the superintendent entered the room, he released her; fear of being betrayed made him more than ordinarily willing to do the superintendent's bidding. He immediately put on his hat with its official striped border and went out. With a sudden desire to play the part of the upright man, he rushed at the women and seized the net.</p>

      <p>*You dirty sluts, don't you know that it means hard labour for you to break the seal of the crown?' he shouted.</p>

      <p>The chorus of women replied by pouring abuse on the heads of superintendent and inspector alike. They cared the devil for the seal of the crown; both gentlemen ought to be in prison themselves.</p>

      <p>The inspector lost his temper and called to a customs official to fetch the police.</p>

      <p>At the word 'police' the fisherfolk came out of their hovels like ants out of an ant-heap at the intrusion of a foreign body.</p>

      <p>They seemed prepared to take the women's part and shouted threats and insults. Axel Borg considered that it was time for him to interfere personally, so as to avoid the semblance of being under the protection of a subordinate. He went up to the crowd and asked them what they wanted.</p>

      <p>When he received no reply, he turned to the women :</p>

      <p>*As I have already told you/ he said sternly, Parliament, that is to say the delegates elected by you, has decided for the good of your children and your children's children to protect the fishing industry by the prohibition of such nets and tackle as will ruin the industry without any material advantage to you. You have had three years to use up all the old nets. But as you have manufactured new ones, entirely disregarding the law, I have been compelled to seize the illegal tackle in the name of the King. Nevertheless, in defiance of the law of the land, you have broken the seal of the crown; the punishment for this offence is hard labour. But I will be lenient with you if you will promise to submit and obey. Therefore I ask you once more: Are you going to give up that net?'</p>

      <p>The only reply was fresh shouts of abuse.</p>

      <p>*Very well,' concluded the superintendent, *as I am no policeman, and you are in the majority, I hereby request the inspector to send to the police station for assistance, and at the same time for a warrant of apprehension for Mrs Oeman.'</p>

      <p>As he uttered the last words, two soft, warm hands seized his right hand; two large, childlike eyes gazed into his, and he heard a voice pleading in the accents of a mother who is pleading for the life of her child.</p>

      <p>f\</p>

      <p>*For Heaven's sake, have mercy on the unhappy woman and don't be hard on her,' begged the girl who had come out of the house at the commencement of the scene.</p>

      <p>Axel Borg tried to release himself and turned away from the pleading eyes whose gaze he was unable to bear; but he felt the pressure on his hand tighten, felt it pressed against a soft bosom. He heard a voice beseeching him in gentle, imploring accents. Completely overcome, he whispered :</p>

      <p>*Lfet me go, I will let the matter drop.'</p>

      <p>The girl loosened her hold. Axel Borg, his plan made in half a second, took the inspector by the arm and led him into the custom-house, as if he intended to give him some directions. When they had reached the door, the superintendent said shortly and decisively, as if he had just made up his mind :</p>

      <p>*I'll write to the Authorities myself. In the meantime, thank you for your assistance.*</p>

      <p>And with these words he went upstairs to his room.</p>

      <p>When he was alone and had time to collect his thoughts, he was bound to admit that the action he had taken was prompted by base motives. His sexual instinct had mastered him to such a degree that he had allowed himself to be beguiled into the commission of an illegal action. There could be no question of</p>

      <p>pity; the Oemans were comparatively well off; they possessed a house, a fishing ground, boats and tackle worth many hundred crowns, seal rookeries and bird clifs; in addition they had a certain amount of capital, and owned some land which they were in the habit of letting. He completely rejected the equally wrong conception that a woman had got the better of him; he had no delusions about himself, and knew very well that he had been conquered by his own instincts or the desire to gain something from this girl. Doubtless, he had lost the respect of the natives; his ojfficial position was shaken; henceforth the island would contain no old woman, no young lad, who would not look down upon him. This, of courses-was a fact which need not trouble him; whether he had authority over these rustics or not, was a matter of indifference. It was far worse^hat the girl, who in the short time had become necessary to his happiness, would from the very outset harbour the conviction that once, at least, she had been the stronger of the two; in a future union the equilibrium would be disturbed.</p>

      <p>He had frequently been attracted by women, ' and had had more than one love affair, but he \ was so firmly convinced that man was superior \ to the intermediary form between man and child, called woman, that he had always foimd</p>

      <p>it impossible to hold back his opinion for any length of time, and therefore his love ajBfairs had invariably been short-lived. He desired to be loved by a woman who would look up to him as the stronger; he must be the idol, not the worshipper; he must be the trunk on which the weak branch was grafted. But he lived in an age of mental epidemics when megalomania was rampant among women. Degenerate, sickly men and political dullards who required the vote of the masses were to blame for it. Therefore he had remained a solitary man. He was well aware that in love a man must give, must allow himself to be duped; that the only way on which to approach a woman was on all fours. He had crawled at times and as long as he had done so, all had been well; but as soon as he had risen to his feet, the end had come; and always with a flood of accusations that he had been false, that his love had been a lie, and other charges of a similar nature.</p>

      <p>In addition to this he, who held within his grasp the loftiest spiritual pleasures, who felt himself to be an exception among men, had no very strong desire for love in its lower aspects; he had never striven to become the supporter of a parasite; never longed to beget competitors. His strong individuality had rebelled against the thought of becoming a</p>

      <p>woman*s means for propagating her kind, a part played by nearly all the men of his generation.</p>

      <p>Bnt in spite of everything he was now again on the horns of a dilemma; in order to draw the beloved woman up to him, he himself must adopt woman's ways and characteristics. He was unable to dissemble or outwardly express what he did not feel, but he possessed a remarkable power of adapting himself to his environment, of putting himself into the place of others. And as the characteristics, the points of view he encountered in other people were nothing but so many stages through which he himself had passed, all he had to do was to draw on his memory and experience, let go the handle and reduce the tension. He had always taken pleasure in women's society. It was a recreation to him and an amusement, in the same way as the society of children is rejuvenating and invigorating, unless through over-abundance it degenerates into a strain.</p>

      <p>He had felt the firm resolve to make this particular woman his wife growing in him. But although he was a scientist and knew that man was a mammal, he was fully aware that human love, like everything else, had undergone evolution and had in its revolutionary process absorbed spiritual qualities without losing its sensuous foundation. He knew</p>

      <p>Digitized</p>

      <p>byGoOgf JE ^^</p>

      <p>exactly how much unhealthy adoration had crept into the conception of love with the reaction of Christianity against the wholly bestial. He loathed the prudery which concealed that which must not be shown; at the same time he denied that bodily intercourse was the end and aim of matrimony. He longed for a complete union of body and soul, in which he, as the stronger acid, would neutralise the passive base without forming, as in chemistry, a new substance, but merely creating a superfluity of free acid which would always give the amalgamation its character and be ready to counteract any attempt at liberation by the base. For human love was no chemical amalgamation but a spiritual and organic union, resembling the former to a certain extent but being by no means the same thing. He consequently expected no increase of his ego, no added strength, but only a heightening of his joy of life. Instead of wanting a support, he offered himself as such, so that he might fathom his own powers and experience the joy of gauging his strength; that he might spend his soul with prodigal hands and yet neither grow weaker nor impoverish himself.</p>

      <p>While he was thus indulging in his reverie, his glances again strayed through the window. They fell at once on her whom he sought.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>The girl was standing outside the porch of Oeman*s cottage, shaking hands with men and women, gently stroking the heads of children, and apparently overwhelmed by the emotion which called forth such great public sympathy,</p>

      <p>*What an extraordinary display of sympathy with criminals !' thought Borg. 'What love for the poor in spirit! And how well they understand each other's instincts, which they call feelings, so that they may publicly flaunt them; these feelings which they consider superior to clear, mature thought/</p>

      <p>The whole scene was such a web of nonsense that it seemed impossible to comprehend it. It clearly proved the chaotic condition produced in those brains and spinal cords by the first feeble efforts to think.</p>

      <p>There she stood, who had beguiled him into an offence against the law, allowing herself to be worshipped as an angel, regardless of the fact that if his offence was really a beautiful action from her point of view, then the thanks were surely due to him who had shown mercy instead of punishing the offenders. The crcJwd, however, were evidently of a different opinion; they well knew that his leniency was not aroused by a feeling of good will towards them, but that he had acted imder the girl's influence; either from courtesy or in the hope of winning her love. Still, the underlying</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>r</p>

      <p>reason for her conduct might, in this instance, be a desire for popularity, a wish to win the sympathy of the crowd, to be praised and cheered. The rabble on this forsaken skerry played the same part as the assembly in a ball room, the passers-by in the street or market place. She had seduced him by a touch, innocent or calculated, probably both, to commit a wrong for which she was now being worshipped.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless he was obsessed by the thought that he must win her, and he realised that he might as well drop his belated musings. He recognised in a flash that through her medium-ship his ideas and plans might filter down to the crowd; that through her he might move the masses, compel them to accept his benefits, make them his henchmen. He could then smile as a god at their foolish boasting that they themselves were the architects of their fortunes, while they were but pregnant with his plans, his thoughts. They should eat the lees of his splendid brewage, but their lips should never touch his strong mead! What did he care whether or not these forsaken skerries supported a half-starved, superfluous race of men ! What compassion could he feel for his natural enemies, who represented the inert masses which had lain on his life like a pall, hindering his growth! They had no</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>pity for each other, and they persecuted, with the hatred of wild beasts, benefactors, who revenged themselves by the bestowal of fresh benefits.</p>

      <p>This should be his great and strong felicity : to be overlooked, to be taken for a fool, and yet to guide the destiny of these men who believed that they had beaten him, bound him hand and foot, cut off all his connexions. He would strike the fools with blindness, rob them of their sight, so that they should imagine themselves his masters and him their servant.</p>

      <p>A knock at the door interrupted his thoughts just as they were culminating in a strong resolve. The inspector entered with an invitation from the ladies to a cup of tea.</p>

      <p>Borg thanked him and sent a message that he would come.</p>

      <p>After having dressed and decided what to say and what to leave unsaid, he went across to Oeman's cottage.</p>

      <p>He met Miss Marie in the porch; she seized his hands and pressed them with exaggerated warmth.</p>

      <p>•How can I thank you for all your kindness to that poor woman?* she said in a voice trembling with emotion. 'It was noble of you, it was great!'</p>

      <p>*It was nothing of the kind,* answered Borg, unhesitatingly. *It was a bad action on my</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>r&gt;</p>

      <p>part, which I regret, and which I only committed to please you. '</p>

      <p>'You are libelling yourself from sheer politeness; I should be far more pleased with a little candour/ replied the girl, as her mother joined them.</p>

      <p>*0h! You're a good boy,' interrupted the mother with imshakable conviction, inviting Borg into the big room where tea was served.</p>

      <p>Borg entered without replying. He saw at a glance that the simple furniture of the fisherman's cottage had been crossed with the shabby fragments of a luxurious town house. Alabaster vases, yellow with age, stood on the chest of drawers, photographs were placed between the flowers on the window sill, an easy chair, covered with flowered chintz and studded with brass nails, filled a comer near the fireplace; a few books were arranged on a little table round a lamp.</p>

      <p>T^t arrangement, which had been carried out with scrupulous mathematical exactitude and regularity, was pretty enough, but everything was just a little crooked, a little lopsided, although it was meant to be straight. The tea-set of old Dresden china, with a gold edge and red initials, was cracked here and there, and the lid of the tea pot was rivetted.</p>

      <p>Borg looked at the portrait of the late husband and father without daring to ask what</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>position he had occupied; he could tell, however, that he had been in the civil service, and that his family was in reduced circumstances.</p>

      <p>They talked of scenery and surroundings, passed on to the event of the day and finally discussed the character of the natives. Axel Borg was not long in finding out that the ladies took a great interest in other people's business, and felt an almost morbid solicitude for the welfare of the lower classes. He soon noticed, however, that his candid opinions irritated them, and as it was not to his advantage to oflFend them by pressing his views, he gave in to them and followed the course of least resistance. Every now and then his inmost con-sciouness rebelled against one or other of their statements, and he longed to venture an explanation, or even contradict them; but immediately it was as if gentle hands closed his lips, soft arms slipped round his neck and choked the words before he could utter them. Moreover, the views of his hostesses v^^re so deeply rooted, they were so convinced of the truth of all they said, that they only smiled indulgently whenever he betrayed a doubt in any of their principles.</p>

      <p>But as soon as they were launched on a discussion of the moral and spiritual state of the colony, Axel Borg woke up. He described with some warmth the drunken brawl, the</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>brutal scenes of the morning, deplored the want of enlightenment and concluded by telling them stories which proved that the natives were still under the sway of almost complete paganism. He related to them how the fishermen sacrificed on stones, loaded their guns with the lead stolen from church windows; talked of Tor's hammer when the thunder was lolling, of Wotan's wild chase when the geese returned in the spring; how in the inner islands of the archipelago they allowed the crows to work havoc among the poultry for fear of unknown avengers if they disturbed their nests.</p>

      <p>*But you can't blame them,' interrupted the elder of the two ladies, *it's not their fault! They would be different if the way to church were not so far!'</p>

      <p>The idea had never struck Borg, but now he saw in a flash the potentiality of a powerful ally. Developing the thought germ which was sown in his heart in the morning as he watched divine service on board the steamer, he called out enthusiastically :</p>

      <p>*But a mission house would be cheap enough! Supposing I wrote to the Government about it!'</p>

      <p>The ladies took up the matter with ardour; they agreed to write to the Foundation and various societies; suggested getting up a</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>bazaar, but almost immediately abandoned the idea, because there was nobody on the island who could dance.</p>

      <p>Borg disposed of all difficulties by offering to advance the money and see to the building, which could be bought ready-made at a factory, if the ladies would undertake to find a lay preacher. 'But,' he added, 'it will have to be a zealous man, one who is ready to attack the people, because in a case like this lukewarm-ness is out of place.'</p>

      <p>The ladies made one or two objections; they were in favour of more gentle and loving means; but Axel Borg proved that fear was the foundation on which civilisation must be built; love might come in later on.</p>

      <p>A lofty mutual interest forged their sotds together, while they warmed their hearts at the fire of a great love. They talked themselves into an overflowing compassion with all things created. They pressed each other's hands and parted with blessings and rejoicings that fate had brought together three good people who would work in harmony for the welfare of humanity.</p>

      <p>As Borg, a few minutes later, stepped out of the porch, he shook himself as if he wanted to shake himself free from dust. He had the sensation which a visit to a mill always gave him : a certain feeling of pleasure at the sight</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>of the mellow, creamy tint of the flour which covered iron, wood, linen and glass, eflFacing all diflFerences. He had the same vague, voluptuous feeling when he touched the locks, banisters, and sacks of flour. At the same time he found it difficultt to breathe; he coughed and pulled out his handkerchief.</p>

      <p>And yet he had spent a pleasant evening. He had basked in the warmth emanating from the mother and falling like dew on the barren thoughts; he had revelled in the atmosphere of childlike simplicity radiating from the girl and rejuvenating him; her childish faith in what had been the ideal of his youthful days : to lift up the fallen, to care for the cripples, to strengthen the sick and the weak.</p>

      <p>He had learned since that it was contrary to promoting the happiness and improvement of the race; he hated it instinctively, because everjrthing that was strong, every sign of originality, was mercilessly persecuted by the incapable. Was he now to form an alliance with it against himself? Was he to work at his own undoing, lower his standard, pretend sympathy for the arch-enemy, pay his opponents' war expenses? The thought of the enjoyment which these trials of strength would yield him, intoxicated him. He turned towards the shore to come to himself again in the great solitude.</p>

      <p>Digitized by. VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>As he was walking along in the still, warm summer night across the sands in which he could trace his own foot-steps of a few days ago; where every stone and every plant was known to him, he noticed a great change. Nothing was the same; everything was transformed. His impressions were quite diflFerent to those he had had on the previous day. Something new had come into his life. He could no longer call up within himself, pitted against nature or humanity, the feeling of absolute loneliness, for somebody was standing behind him, by the side of him. His isolation was a thing of the past. He was chained to this petty, every-day life; threads had been spun round his soul; consideration for others was beginning to fetter his thoughts; a cowardly fear of thinking on lines different to those of his friends, clutched him.</p>

      <p>He dared not build up his happiness on an insecure foundation, for fear that when he had reached the roof, the whole building would totter and fall to the ground. Then the fall would be deeper, the pain more bitter! And yet he had to do it, if he wanted to call her his own; and to make her his wife he was resolved with the full strength of manhood which can move mountains.</p>

      <p>Lift her up to him? How could that be done ? He could not make a man of her, could</p>

      <p>not deliver her from the untameable instincts which she owed to her sex; he could not give her his own education which had taken thirty years, the evolutionary training he had undergone, the experience he had bought, the studies he had pursued.</p>

      <p>He must stoop down to her, then. But the thought of this stooping tormented him as the greatest possible evil, appeared to him as degeneration, a coming down in the world, a beginning again at the beginning; an impossible contingency. The only remaining alternative was the doubling of his personality, a splitting of himself in two, thereby creating a being which she could understand and appreciate; he must play the lover outwitted, admire her inferiority, act his part as she would like him to act it. And he must live the other half of his life silently and in secrecy; sleep always with one eye open.</p>

      <p>He had unconsciously climbed the cliflF. He could see lights in the fishing village and hear wild screams; shouts of triumph over the beaten foe, whose wish it had been to raise their children and children's children from poverty, and put new pleasures within their reach. ^ All of a sudden the longing awoke in him again to see these savages tamed, these worshippers of Tor bend their knee before the white Christ, the giants overcome by the gentle</p>

      <p>Aesir. The barbarian must pass through Christianity as through purgatory, must learn to reverence the power of the spirit in a weak frame. These Huns and Goths must pass through their Middle-Ages before they could reach the Renascence of thought and the Revolution of action.</p>

      <p>His thought snapped; he pondered. A smile flitted across his pale face as he stooped down and picked up four pieces of gneiss, marking with them a rectangle from east to west, after having taken thirty steps in length and twenty in breadth.</p>

      <p>What a splendid landmark for a seafaring man! he mused, as he slowly descended the cli£E and walked home.</p>

      <p>The Superintendent of Fisheries shut himself up for two days to work. As he went out for a walk on the third morning, chance threw him into the way of the old lady. She looked distressed, and when Borg enquired after her daughter, she told him that the girl was not at all well.</p>

      <p>*It's want of occupation,* he said, merely in order to say something.</p>

      <p>* There's nothing to be done in this wilderness,' sighed the distressed mother.</p>

      <p>*Miss Marie should go out fishing and sailing, and stir about a little,' he prescribed, thoughtlessly.</p>

      <p>*0h! that's all very well,' agreed the mother^ *but poor Marie can't go by herself.'</p>

      <p>The reply to this was obvious.</p>

      <p>*I shall be very pleased to be of service,' he said, *if the ladies will put up with my company.'</p>

      <p>The delighted mother accepted the oflFer and hurried oflE to tell Marie to get ready.</p>

      <p>Axel Borg went on to the harbour to see to</p>

      <p>Mt</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>the boat. Gradually he slackened his footsteps, as if some unseen pressure were pushing him down a slope faster than he intended to go. He was loath to be set in motion by some outside agency before he had had time to think. He longed to resist, but was unable to do so. It was too late now, therefore he allowed him-self to drift, conscious that he cotdd always take the helm and steer whither he would.</p>

      <p>He had hoisted the foresail, unshipped the tiller and loosened the painter, so as to be able to let it go at a moment*s notice, when Marie and her mother appeared on the shore. The girl was wearing a navy-blue dress, trimmed with white braid; her blue woollen tam-o'-shanter suited her to perfection and gave her face an expression of boyish impudence, very different from the angelic air of a few days ago.</p>

      <p>When the usual civilities had been exchanged, Borg prepared to help the ladies into the boat. The girl took his proflFered hand and jumped lightly on board, where Borg placed her at the helm. But when he held out his hand to the mother, she declared she could not come, as she had to look after the dinner.</p>

      <p>This surprise was too sudden, and again Borg felt prompted to resist the gentle force which pushed him whither he did not wish to go. But fear of being considered ill-mannered held him back. He regretted that they would</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>be deprived of the old lady's pleasant comr pany, let go the painter, directed Marie to shift the helm, put the mainsheet into her hand and hoisted the sail.</p>

      <p>'But I don't know how to sail a boat/ exclaimed the girl, 'I've never held a tiller in my life ! '</p>

      <p>'There's not the slightest difficulty about it,' answered Borg, sitting down before her and assisting her in her manoeuvring, *do as I tell you and you'll make a perfect sailor.'</p>

      <p>A faint breeze was blowing and the boat glided out of the harbour before a side wind.</p>

      <p>Borg held the fore-sheet and gave instructions to the pretty helmswoman, seizing her wrist every now and then and pressing the tiller against the wind, until they had left the harbour behind them, were well on the way and stood on a direct tack to the Skerries.</p>

      <p>The sense of responsibility, the exertion, the feeling that she guided the vessel which carried both their lives, stirred up latent powers in the soft, yielding figure; her eyes, carefully watching the sails, sparkled with courage and self-confidence when she realised that the b9at obeyed the slightest pressure of her hand.</p>

      <p>Whenever she made a mistake, he corrected her with a few gentle words, encouraged her by praising her close attention, and removed</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>all difficulties by pretending that the whole proceeding was a mere matter of course.</p>

      <p>She was radiant with happiness and began to speak of the past, of her thirty-four years; she told him that she had believed that life and joy were over for her; but that she felt young again; that she had always dreamed of an active life, a man's life, so that she might devote all her energy to mankind. She knew that being a woman meant being a pariah . . .</p>

      <p>Borg listened to all these open secrets, the formulae of a senseless striving to equalise what nature, purposely, had made as unlike as possible to save humanity tmnecessary labour.</p>

      <p>But to answer them now seemed to him a waste of time and energy. He therefore continued acting his part as a privileged listener, and let her voice the unhealthy fancies which the wind would blow away. Instead of taking the knife and cutting the confused skein of her thoughts, he would simply ignore its existence. By stirring up impressions which he would porposely produce, he would unravel the old jumble and use it as a foundation on the spools where he would wind the good rich yam of his own spinning.</p>

      <p>A scheme flashed into his mind which would enable him to make her pass within a few</p>

      <p>K</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>hours through a series of sensations, coming from outside in her opinion, by using, without her being aware of it, the living pictures of the Skerries as a means of instruction. In this way he would silently spread the net of his soul over her soul, and tune its strings so that they should be in harmony with the music of his own.</p>

      <p>With a movement of his head he indicated that she should allow the boat to drift. He slackened the sheet, the boat had dropped the land and gently plashed across the open surface. The wide horizon, the infinite sea of light, void of all objects, threw a radiance on the girVs beautiful face; her small features seemed to grow, her almost invisible lines were smoothed out, her whole expression was one of delivery from every-day cares and petty thoughts. The eye which, at a single glance, could take in a comparatively large part of the globe, had lost the grasp of small things; the slender figure seemed to expand and feel its power. But when the huge rollers lifted and dropped the boat in powerful rhythms, he could see a breath of fear dimming her ecstasy and trying to hinder the flight of her thoughts.</p>

      <p>Borg noticed that the magnificent spectacle had made an impression, and resolved to put a text to the soft music of her emotion, guide her vague gropings on to the great path. He</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>would loosen the husks of the swelling seed-buds, so that the seed could grow.</p>

      <p>*The power of the planet is manifesting itself/ he mused aloud. *Earth, the every-day, dull, dusty earth, has become a star. Do we not win Heaven as soon as we realise that the contrast between Heaven and Earth is a mere illusion? That they are as much one as a whole and the part of a whole ? Do you not feel that instead of shrinking you grow when you have succeeded in outwitting the wind and compelled it to carry you to the right when it blew to the left? Are you not conscious of the splendid power dwelling within you, when you ride on the crest of the wave which, with the pressure of a thousand pounds, would fling you into the abyss ? He who is said to have created the wings of a bird, and required fifty thousand years to make a flyer out of a crawler, was less intelligent than he who first hoisted a piece of cloth on the top of a pole, and so, in one second, invented navigation. Is it wonderful, therefore, that man, intellectual man, created God in his image, by deducing a still more intellectual spirit ? ^</p>

      <p>The girl had listened to him attentively, steadfastly regarding his face, as if she had turned to a fire to warm herself. The unusual words seemed to have made a deep impression on her, and to act like leaven.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>Lulled by the gentle, persuasive accents, she accepted without hesitation the new points of view which he had given her on human origin and destiny, a subject which up to now had been to her like a stony and lifeless desert. Without comprehending that her own religious convictions were being buried before they were dead, she accepted the new theories, piling them up on the old doctrine.</p>

      <p>'You talk as I never heard anybody talking before,' she said dreamily, *go on!'</p>

      <p>He was silent and with a quick movement changed the course of the boat.</p>

      <p>They were approaching the skerry with the gloomy formation of vulcanite, the Black-CliflF, as it was called. The black, sparkling diorite with the ghastly sea-mark, 'The White Mare', looked even more lowering in the sunshine, which vainly tried to blend the two extremes, black and white.</p>

      <p>The girl's face clouded over, her features seemed to shrink, she frowned and drew down her eye-brows, as if she wanted to shut out the depressing sight. A little jerk of the helm indicated that she meant to stand oflE; but he kept the boat to her course, and the force of the wind shot her straight into the gully between the black cliflFs, from whence the sobbing seas sucked her slowly forward.</p>

      <p>Silence fell in the boat. Borg did not</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>attempt to speculate on the melancholy memories which the grim surroundings awakened in his companion; he confined himself to pointing out to her the bleached skeleton of a grebe which lay on the black rock.</p>

      <p>The wind filled the sails again and carried the boat out of the gully into the open water.</p>

      <p>They sailed past the cliff with the solitary mountain-ash and the water wagtail, and approached the Swordholm, where he had seen her for the first time.</p>

      <p>There they landed and he led her along the same path on which he had come that Sunday morning; he made her receive the same impressions which he himself had received, and finally took her down to the flowering meadow and showed her, between the crab-apple trees, the place from where he had seen her for the first time.</p>

      <p>This roused a mischievous mood in her, for the fact that he remembered these trifles seemed to prove that he was in love. She laughed when he told her that the first indication of her presence had been a cough; in a spirit of playfulness she asked him to go back to the place and speak; then she would guess who it was.</p>

      <p>He obeyed, scrambled down the cliff, hid behind the timber trees and began to bellow like a bull.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>'Oh ! but he can sing beautifully!' laughed the girl. *I think he must be a Hottentot actor.'</p>

      <p>Her childishness amused Borg who had not played with children for many years, and he went on acting the part. He came out from behind the trees on the grass plot, turned his coat inside out, hung his eye-glass over one ear and danced an improvised savage dance, accompanying it with a song which he had heard the Hottentots singing in the JarJIi d'Acclimation.</p>

      <p>The girl was surprised and delighted.</p>

      <p>*Do you know,' she said, *I like you ever so much better now that I know that you can drop the philosophic mask at any moment, and be a human being.'</p>

      <p>'But do you prefer the Hottentot to the philosopher?' The words had escaped Borg almost against his will, and he immediately regretted having broken the spell. He broke a little branch oflE the timber tree, twisted it into a garland and handed it to the girl, whose spirits had sunk when she realised that she had made a stupid remark.</p>

      <p>Tlease decorate the victim. Miss Marie,' pleaded Borg. *I wish I were a hundred bulls, to be sacrificed to you as a hecatomb.* . He bent his knee and the mollified beauty wound the garland round his brow. Then he ran down to the shore, the girl following him.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>They did not stop until they reached the sandy beach. .</p>

      <p>'Shall we play ducks and drakes?* she suggested.</p>

      <p>*Yes, let's!' he assented eagerly, choosing a flat stone.</p>

      <p>They played for a little while until they grew hot.</p>

      <p>'Let's bathe!' she burst out suddenly, as if she had been brooding over this thought until she could retain it no longer.</p>

      <p>Borg did not know what to say; he wondered whether she was serious, whether she meant to keep on some of her clothes, or wanted him to go away.</p>

      <p>'All right; bathe if you want to; I'll come back when you've had enough,' he stammered in the end.</p>

      <p>'But won't you bathe?' asked the girl.</p>

      <p>'No; I haven't got my bathing suit,' answered Borg, 'and, moreover, I never bathe in cold water.'</p>

      <p>'Hahahaha!' It was a cold, disagreeable laugh from the girl's throat. 'Are you afraid of cold water?' she scofied. 'Perhaps you can't swim?'</p>

      <p>'My sensitive nerves can't stand the shock of the cold water. But if you are going to take a cold bath here, I will take a warm one on the northern headland.'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC ,</p>

      <p>The girl had already taken oflE her laced boots.</p>

      <p>'I hope you won't be able to see me from there ?• she said, with a look of offended vanity and contempt,</p>

      <p>'As long as you don't swim out too far/ replied Borg as he left her.</p>

      <p>When he had reached the northern declivities of the islet, he selected a mountain-cleft protected from the north wind by a wall of rock, fifty yards high. The black, amphibolic gneiss had been polished by the waves till they had the appearance of agate. The slight corrugations of the surface looked like the muscles of the human body, and fitted like a bolster into the cavities of the bare foot. No breath of wind could come here, and the burning rays of the sun had scorched the black rock for the last six hours, so that the temperature of the air was several degrees above the temperature of the body, and the stones almost burned the naked feet.</p>

      <p>He fetched an axe from the boat, cut off the driest heather, the most parched looking sand-oats, and made a roaring fire on the cliff while he undressed. When the fire had died down, he swept the rock clean like a baker's oven, poured, with a baling ladle, the crystal sea-water on the heated surface and let the steam envelop his body. Then he sat down in one</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>of the arm-chairs which the sea had carved out of the rock, pulled his rug over him, drew his knees up to his chin, shut his eyes and seemed to fall asleep.</p>

      <p>But he did not sleep; it was merely his method of winding himself up, as he called it, so as to allow his brain to rest for a few seconds and regain its elasticity. It was a strain on him to adapt himself to the less highly evolved mentality of others. The mechanism of his thoughts suffered from the contact with other brains, became restless and tmreliable like a magnetic needle in the vicinity of iron. Whenever he wanted to clear his thoughts, or foi-m an important decision, he took a warm bath to throw his soul into a state of harmonious stupor; he extinguished consciousness for a moment in a sort of semi-sleep, by thinking of nothing. This brought the material of observation which he had absorbed to a condition of liquefaction, and when he extinguished the fires and brought himself back to consciousness, the alloy was ready.</p>

      <p>After he had let the sun warm him for a little while, he suddenly stood up, wide-awake, as after a night's unbroken rest. His thoughts were busy and a happy smile played over his features, as if he had solved a difficult problem</p>

      <p>'She is thirty.four,* he thought, 'I had for-</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQI</p>

      <p>gotten that under the influence of her youthful beauty. Hence this chaos of stages left behind, these fragments of parts which she has played in life, this crowd of changing reflections of the men she has tried to win, and to whom, at one time or another, she adapted herself. And she must have suffered shipwreck in a love affair quite recently. The man who kept all these soul fragments together abandoned her; the sack broke, and now everything is lying about; scattered like the lumber in a rag-picker's shop. She has shown samples of the pious romanticism of 1850, and has babbled of the salvation of humanity which was a favourite topic in the beginning of this century; she draws religions zeal from the joint voices of the dove and the pietist, utters cynicisms dating from the time of George Sand and the viragoes ... *</p>

      <p>His common-sense saved him from attempting to find the bottom in this sieve through which so many soups had been strained; to waste time on the solution of a*riddle which was no riddle. The only thing to do was to select from the heap of bones those which he could build up into a skeleton; this done, he must cover it with living flesh and breathe into it the breath of his spirit. But he would have to be careful and not let her guess his intention, for if she did guess it, she would never</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>permit it. She must never know how he regarded her, for it would only awaken hatred and resistance in her. He must grow sub-terraneously, as a root, and graft her on to him, then shoot up and show to the world the blossom which all eyes would admire.</p>

      <p>The screaming of the sea-gulls suggested that she had swum out to sea. He hastily dressed.</p>

      <p>When he had collected all his things, he carried up from the boat a little luncheon, which he spread out on the moss under a half-grown pine tree.</p>

      <p>There were but a few dishes, served on the remnants of a collection of precious china, he had once started. The butter, golden as the yolk of an egg, was packed in a dish of saponite with a screw lid, and stood on ice heaped up in the fragment of a china pot of the time of Henry II; the biscuits lay on a perforated plate from Marienberg, and the anchovies on a saucer from Nevers.</p>

      <p>A hearty dislike of the all-invading commonplace in art and literature had sent the owner in search of originality; he had shared the fate of many others and had been driven to luxuriousness in order to save his individuality from being ground down in the great flood of rubble stones. His finely developed senses could not merely seek beauty</p>

      <p>Digitized</p>

      <p>by Google ^^^^</p>

      <p>in shape and colour, which so quickly lose their charm; he wanted to surround himself with associations, mementoes of events of world-wide importance. This fragment of a china pot of Henry the Second's time, made of creamy white clay, crusted over with red, black and gold, called up memories of the beautiful country of the Loire and its castles, built in the period of the Renascence. Its decoration in the style of a book cover was reminiscent of the chatelaine Helena of Hengst and her librarian who, with the assistance of a potter, created a style, purely personal and yet coloured by the period of knighthood; that period when beauty was everything, and even the crafts willingly bowed down to art and science, fully realising the advantages of a spiritual order.</p>

      <p>When, everything being ready, he regarded the work of his hands, it seemed to him that he had brought a fragment of culture into this semi-arctic desert. Anchovies from Brittany, chestnuts from Andalusia, caviare from the Volga, cheese from the Swiss Alps, sausage from Thuringia, biscuits from Great Britain and oranges from Asia Minor; a bottle of Chianti, covered with wickerwork, to be drunk out of stem glasses, bearing in gilt letters the name of Frederick I; all this formed a medley without a hint of the collector or the museum;</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>little splashes of colour here and there; flowers, pressed as keepsakes between the leaves of a book of travel instead of in a flower-press.</p>

      <p>Now he heard the girVs voice calling to him from her bathing place. He shouted back.</p>

      <p>A few moments afterwards she emerged from the undergrowth, straight, fresh and radiant with health and happiness. When she caught sight of the luncheon prepared by him, she raised her cap and made him a mock bow. Nevertheless he could see plainly that the elegance of his arrangements impressed her.</p>

      <p>'You are a magician,* she said; 'allow me to do you homage.'</p>

      <p>'Not for so little,* he replied,</p>

      <p>'You are hinting at greater powers,* she laughed. 'But as for ruling the forces of nature, as you professed to be able to do a little while ago, let me counsel you to leave these things alone.* She spoke in superior, motherly accents.</p>

      <p>'I never said anything so definite; I only mentioned that we have partly enslaved the forces of nature and partly obey them. Please notice the important little word partly. Furthermore, I said that it is within our power to alter the character of a landscape and the entire psychology of its inhabitants.*</p>

      <p>'Very well, then; please transform this</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>terrible greystone scenery into an Italian landscape with marble villas and stone pines.'</p>

      <p>*I'm no conjuror, but as you challenge me, I'll promise you to transform this wonderful green landscape, the like of which is not to be found in Europe, in three weeks from this day, into a tree-less, sun-scorched cauliflower scenery, such as you seem to admire. This shall be my birthday present to you.'</p>

      <p>'Done! In three weeks ! And if I lose ?'</p>

      <p>*Then I shall win—what?'</p>

      <p>'That remains to be seen !'</p>

      <p>'That remains to be seen ! But will you do my work in the meantime?'</p>

      <p>'What is your work? To lie on the sofa and smoke cigarettes?*</p>

      <p>'Well, yes, if you can do my work from the sofa, as I can. But you can't. And I'll tell you why, and why I'm here on this skerry. But let me pour you out some wine first.*</p>

      <p>He filled a glass with the dark red Chianti and handed it to the girl who drank it at a gulp.</p>

      <p>'You know,' began Borg, 'my ofl&amp;cial task here in this village is to teach the people to fish.'</p>

      <p>'And that will be a huge success! I heard you boasting that you never held a rod in your hand all your life.'</p>

      <p>'Don't interrupt me—I'm not here to teach</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>them the art of angling. The fact is this: those laggards, conservative as the rabble always is . . .'</p>

      <p>'What language!' interrupted the girl.</p>

      <p>'Candid language! However—^these aborigines are undermining their position as fish-eating animals from sheer stupidity and conservatism. Therefore the State is compelled to put them under the care of trustees. The stromming—^bless the fish!—^which forms the staple food of these autochthons, threatens to become extinct. This, of course, is a matter of perfect indifference to me; whether a super-flous tribe of men contains a hundred fish-eaters more or less, has no bearing whatever on the great scheme of the Universe. But the Agricultural College desires them to remain \ alive, and therefore I am here to prevent them j from catching their scant sustenance. Do / you admit the logic of this ?'</p>

      <p>'It's inhuman, but then you are made of the wood out of which hangmen are carved.*</p>

      <p>'Therefore, acting on my own impulse, and without aspiring to the order of Vasa or any thanks whatever, I have discovered a new source of income for them which shall replace the old one. Even if the stromming after half a life-time, when all the inhabitants of the skerries have emigrated, should swim about these waters in shoals, this industry is</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>threatened by a formidable competitor who, after an interval of a hundred years, is making its re-appearance. Do you know that the herring will come back to the West Coast in the autumn?*</p>

      <p>*No, it's a long time since I heard from it.'</p>

      <p>'Well, anyhow, ifs a certainty. The consequence is that we must leave the stromming alone and fish for salmon.*</p>

      <p>'Salmon? In the depth of the sea?*</p>

      <p>'Yes ! It must be there, although I've not yet seen it. You shall find it! *</p>

      <p>'But supposing it weren't there.'</p>

      <p>'I'm telling you that it is! You need but catch the first few, and the salmon fishery is opened.'</p>

      <p>'How can you know that there is salmon when you've never seen a sign of it?' scoffed the girl.</p>

      <p>'My investigations prove it. They are so complicated that I can't explain them to you, now; I have conducted them partly from my boat, on the sea . . .'</p>

      <p>'Once I'</p>

      <p>'I work as fast as twenty others, thanks to my unusual knowledge, partly acquired by lying on the sofa and thinking, and partly, mostly perhaps, derived from books. But be that as it may, will you be an accessory in the undoing of the natives,. first by the opening</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>up of the salmon industry and, secondly, by the influence of the mission-house which you seem to have forgotten?'</p>

      <p>* You're a demon, a fiend!* exclaimed the girl, half laughing, half uneasy.</p>

      <p>Borg's cynicism had been but a whimsical mood; but when he saw that it impressed her more than anything else, he went on acting the part.</p>

      <p>'Is it really true that you don't believe in God?' asked Miss Marie, with an expression as if she would abhor him in all eternity if he pleaded guilty.</p>

      <p>*Yes, quite true!'</p>

      <p>*And you want to be another Anscarius and introduce Christianity on the skerry?'</p>

      <p>* And the salmon fishery! Yes, I want to be a demoniacal Anscarius! But will you set the salmon lines and be blessed by the Auditors of the Riksdag?'</p>

      <p>*Yes, I will work for these people in whom I have faith; I will place my weak powers at the disposal of these oppressed ones; I will prove to you that you are a blas6, cynical, worn-out . . . but no, you aren't; you are libelling yourself, you are really a good boy; I saw it on Sunday . . .'</p>

      <p>L</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>role of the demon; a demon is a superior being and far more interesting than a boy, and therefore he stuck to the more effective part. True, he knew from experience that the easiest way of finding favour with a woman was to allow her to play the little mother, a part which permits a good deal of intimacy. But it was so hackneyed a game and might so easily have produced an ineradicable arrogance in her. She had better play the more grateful role of the redeemer. It contained nothing which would necessitate her domineering over him; she would have but the task of the Mother of God : to mediate. She would tie placed as mediator between two equally strong powers.</p>

      <p>But it was not easy to carry his idea into effect. A feeling of weariness at all this fuss, unavoidable if he wanted to win the game, led him to pretend that he must go and see whether the boat was safely moored, for the wind was getting up.</p>

      <p>When he reached the shore he drew .a deep breath, like a man who has been tried above his strength. He unbuttoned his waistcoat as if it were a coat of mail, let the fresh breeze cool his brow, and cast a look of longing at the open sea. He would have given much, now, to be able to be alone, to shake off the chaff which, at the contact with a lower intellect.</p>

      <p>Digitized by Google I</p>

      <p>had fallen on his soul. He hated her at this moment, he wonld have liked to be free from her, master of himself, but it was too late! The cobwebs had wound round his face, soft, silky, invisible, and nothing could remove them.</p>

      <p>When he turned round and saw her peeling a chestnut with her long fingers and sharp teeth, he thought of a mandrill which he had seen in a menagerie. A feeling of infinite compassion welled up in his heart, a breath of that melancholy which a happier individual feels on meeting a degraded fellow-creature. But he immediately remembered her delight when he had played the Hottentot, and his irritation returned. Finally he pulled himself together with an eflFort, and with the self-control of a man of the world made his way back to her. Merely to say something with which to cloak his feelings, he suggested that they should start on their homeward journey, as the breeze was freshening.</p>

      <p>But she had seen the expression of weariness and absent-mindedness on his face.</p>

      <p>'You are tired of me!' she said with a sharpness which completely lepelled him for the moment. 'Let us go.'</p>

      <p>As the expected compliment was not forthcoming, she continued with an emotion which might have been true or assumed :</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>• 'Forgive my unkind words! I am what life has made me, and I am ungrateful! There, now you know!'</p>

      <p>She wiped her eyes, and with the practised care of the housewife gathered together the remnants of the feast and collected the china. Tying the tablecloth round her waist like an apron, she prepared to carry the dirty crockery down to the shore and wash it. He tried to take it from her, prompted by an intense dislike of seeing her do the work of a menial. He hated her to wait on him; he wanted to raise her on a pedestal, while she should look up to him who had given her power over him.</p>

      <p>In their playful quarrel as to who should wait on the other, the girl dropped the crockery. She gave a scream; but when she looked at the pieces, her face cleared.</p>

      <p>* Thank goodness, they're only old things! But I was frightened !'</p>

      <p>He suppressed a petty thought of the loss, putting himself into the place of her who was to blame for the disaster. Glad that his conflicting moods had come to a noisy end, he played ducks and drakes with the pieces, and closed the embarrassing situation with a jest :</p>

      <p>*We needn't wash up now!'</p>

      <p>And he helped her into the boat which, to the accompaniment of the plashing of the growing seas, was tugging at the rope.</p>

      <p>A SUNNY summer morning found the Superintendent of Fisheries and his pupil sitting in the wooden pavilion which he had had put up on the highest ridge of the skerry, close to the recently laid foundation stone of the mission house.</p>

      <p>In the harbour below lay a schooner, discharging the ready-made parts of the building. The pieces were carried straight to their places and put together by the foreman and his gang. The island had therefore been for some time the scene of unusual activity. There had been a few fights between the fishermen and the labourers from the town, because the latter treated the former with a good deal of insolence. The immediate result was a number of feasts of reconciliation, which again led to more drunkenness and fresh brawls, and even to offences against morality and the right of property.</p>

      <p>The Superintendent of Fisheries and the old lady had had moments in which they regretted having meddled with the spiritual condition of the natives, since the first fruits of their</p>

      <p>lift</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>attempted interposition were so little encouraging.</p>

      <p>Moreover, the nightly scenes, the singing, shouting, and quarreling disturbed the ladies in their work and their rest, and so defeated the purpose which had brought them to the skerry. The Superintendent had lost his prestige on that fatal Sunday on which he had given way to the crowd, and was powerless to re-establish order. Miss Marie was more fortunate; her liveliness, a kind word to the people now and again, were frequently instrumental in calming the storm.</p>

      <p>As she was unwilling to ascribe this success ^ to her beauty and charm of manner, she jumped to the conclusion that she possessed more strength and intelligence than was really the case; and she became so convinced that she really was endowed with unusual mental qualities that even now, sitting as a pupil by the side of her preceptor, listening to his arguments as if they were nothing new to her, she was far more bent on improving and explaining his facts by the interpolation of remarks, more hypercritical than subtle as a rule, ^han on attempting to comprehend and absorb them.</p>

      <p>Her mother was sitting by her side, quietly embroidering a cover for the pulpit of the new mission house, and whenever the girl by a foolish question succeeded in reducing her</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>preceptor to silence, she looked up startled,. taken aback by her daughter's penetrating intelligence and vast knowledge. »</p>

      <p>*Don't you see. Miss Marie,' said Axelf Borg, who still cherished the hope of being&gt; able to improve her mind, *the uncultured eye' is inclined to receive simple impressions; the undeveloped ear to hear simple sounds. You see nothing but grey stone all around, just as the artists and the poets do. That accounts for the monotony of their paintings and descriptions; that's why they find the skerries so dull. But just look at this geological map of the country, just look at the landscape. We are sitting on a formation of red gneiss. Look at this fragment of stone which you call grey-stone; notice the rich variety of black mica, white quartz and pink felspar of which it is composed.'</p>

      <p>He had taken a specimen from a heap of stones which the excavators had blasted off the rock and piled up at the foot of the building.</p>

      <p>'And look at this one here! It's called eurite. Look at the delicate tints, ranging from salmon-pink to flint-blue. And here you have white marble or primitive lime.*</p>

      <p>*Do these rocks contain marble?' asked the pupil, her attention arrested by the name of this stone of luxury.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>*0h! yes, plenty, although it looks grey, without being grey. If you examine it more closely, you will find a marvellous wealth of colour in the lichen. A gradation of the most delicate shades from the deepest lamp-black to the brightest gold . . . Look more carefully at the skerries which are now fully illuminated by the sun, and you will see that the cliffs vary in colour. The natives, who are very observant, have given them names according to their hues, which they realised unconsciously. Don't you see that the Black Cliff is blacker than the rest, because it consists of the dark hornblende; that the Red Reef is red because it is formed of red gneiss; the White Skerry of smoothly polished eurite . . . Isn't it better to know why it is so, than simply to know that it is so? And isn't it still less satisfactory to see nothing but a monotonous grey, as the artists do who paint all the skerries in a mixture of black and white? Listen, now, to the rushing of the waves, as the poets summarily call this symphony of sounds. Close your eyes for a few moments, then you will hear better, while I dissect this harmony into single notes. First you hear a rushing, similar to the noise in an engine room or a great town; this is caused by the mutual contact of the huge masses of water. Next you hear a hissing sound; this is produced by</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>the smaller, lighter particles which are being lashed into foam; now you hear a scraping of the wave on the sand; now a clatter as if a cartloadful of gravel were being overturned : those; are the small stones which the sea throws out; then a deep, hollow roar: it is the wave driving the air before it and pressing it into a cavity; and last of all a rolling as of distant thunder: those are the great boulders rolling about on the shingly ground.'</p>

      <p>*But this is breaking up nature !' exclaimed the girl. .</p>

      <p>*No! it's being familiar with itl'^o me knowledge is rest. It delivers me from the poet's only half-concealed fear of the unknown, which is nothing but a memory of the groping of the savage^-at a time when humanity craved for the explanation of natural phenomena, but could not find it in a hurry and therefore, for the want of anything better, substituted fables of mermaids and giants. But now, let us talk of the fishing industry which it is our task to revive; let's leave the salmon out of the question for a time and try new methods with the stromming. In two months the height of the fishing season will be here, and if I am not very much mistaken, it will be a failure this autumn.'</p>

      <p>*How can you predict that from your sofa ?' asked the girl, more critically than curiously.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>*I predict it because I have seen—from my sofa—^how in the spring the drift ice has scraped off all the sea-weed and algae in which the stromming lays its eggs. I predict it because the little crab-like animals, never mind what they are called, on which the stromming feeds, stayed away from the banks after the sea-weed had been scraped off. What's to be done therefore ? An effort must be made to catch it in the deep waters. If the fish do not come to us, we must go to the fish. We must make a trial with drift nets which float in the wake of a drifting boat. That's simple enough.'</p>

      <p>'A grand idea!' exclaimed Miss Marie.</p>

      <p>*It's an old method,' objected Borg, *not my invention by any means. But, being intelligent beings, we must cover our retreat. If we catch stromming and don't get a fair price for it because the herring is caught again on the West Coast, we must have another iron in the fire.'</p>

      <p>*The salmon!'</p>

      <p>*Yes, the salmon, which I am sure is here, although, as I said, I have not yet seen it.' ^</p>

      <p>*We got so far last time. But now tell me how you can possibly know that?'</p>

      <p>'I will cut the matter short and tell you in a few words why I am so certain. The salmon migrates like other migratory birds.'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>BY THE OPEN SEA . 171</p>

      <p>*Is the salmon a bird, then?*</p>

      <p>*Yes, certainly, a genuine migratory bird. It is at home in the rivers of Norrland. It is found, occasionally, in draw nets in the Northern Archipelago, is caught off Gotland and on the whole route to the south; therefore it must pass these skerries. Now it will be your task to find it with floating long lines. Would you care to be my assistant artd draw a salary?*</p>

      <p>The last proposal was very sudden, but it was calculated and did not miss its effect.</p>

      <p>* I'm to earn money. Mama,* exclaimed Miss Marie, trying to hide her genuine pleasure behind a show of amusement. *But,' she added, *what are you going to do?*</p>

      <p>'I shall lie on my sofa and, moreover, am I not imder contract to break up nature for you ?*</p>

      <p>'What are you going to do?* asked the mother, unwilling to trust her ears.</p>

      <p>*I have promised Miss Marie to make an Italian landscape for her,* answered Borg. 'I must be off now, and make a rough sketch of it.*</p>

      <p>With these words he rose, bowed courteously and went down to the strand.</p>

      <p>'He*s a strange man,* said the mother, as she watched Borg disappearing in the distance.</p>

      <p>*A very original man anyhow,* answered the daughter. *But I don*t believe that he*s</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>n</p>

      <p>172 BY THE OPEN SEA</p>

      <p>quite right in his head. He seems to have principles, though, and on the whole I believe he means well. What do you think of him?'</p>

      <p>*Give me my ball of wool, child,' answered the mother.</p>

      <p>*Do say something—^tell me whether you like him or not,' pleaded the girl.</p>

      <p>The mother's reply was a melancholy, half-resigned glance which clearly implied that she did not know.</p>

      <p>In the meantime Borg had reached the harbour, unmoored his boat, and rowed out to the skerries.</p>

      <p>They had had a whole month of summer heat, so that the air was very hot. But from the north, where an unusually hard winter had produced ground ice, came huge floes of drift ice, floating to the south and cooling the water to such a degree that the lower layers of air retained a greater density than the upper ones. Refraction altered the appearance of the skerries and during the last few days had caused the most magnificent mirages.</p>

      <p>These phenomena had provoked lengthy discussions between the superintendent and the ladies. Finally the fishermen were appealed to as umpires; they were considered competent to give a decision because they, were accustomed to these sights from their earliest infancy. One morning when, through refrac-</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>tion, the rosy gneiss rocks appeared much higher than they were in reality, and the varying density of the aerial layers made thera look like the cliffs of Normandy, Miss Marie advanced a theory that what they saw were actually those calcareous rocks, reflected here, in the Baltic, in accordance with a still unexplained natural law. On the same occasion the white spray of the waves between the boulders had been so enlarged and magnified that it really resembled a flotilla of Norman vessels cruising off the Falaises.</p>

      <p>Borg had unsuccessfully tried to explain the mirage in the only correct, scientific way, and thereby rob it of its supernatural flavour. The people were inclined to see in the phenomenon a prophecy of coming misfortune; they were even weak enough to allow their superstition to paralyse their energies : Borg clearly saw that if he wanted to bring his explanation home to the natives, he must first appear to them in the character of a magician; but he was resolved to rid his performance later on of every supernatural feature and show them exactly how he had worked his conjuring tricks.</p>

      <p>He had asked the credulous whether, if they were to see the mirage of an Italian landscape, they would believe that what they saw was actually a reflection of Italy? As the reply</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>had been in the afl&amp;rmative, he had made up his mind to kill two birds with one stone, and by a few alterations produce the southern landscape which he had promised Miss Marie as a birthday present. It should be the next mirage, and they should see it on a grand scale, for they would be gazing at it through the colossal aerial magnifying glass with its layers of varying density.</p>

      <p>Sitting in his boat he now carefully observed the Swordholm with his diopter, the lenses of which, he had greatly strengthened. The primary necessity was to bring out the most striking characteristics of the formation, a task which nature had already partly performed for him. In addition to this he required a stone pine, a cypress, a marble palace and a terrace with orange trees planted against the wall.</p>

      <p>As soon as he had sketched the outline of the skerry, his plan was clear. He landed with his cargo consisting of a crow-bar, a scraper, a coil of zinc wire, a bucket of yellow ochre, a large tar-brush, an axe, a saw, nails, and a number of dynamite cartridges.</p>

      <p>When he had unloaded his boat, he felt likt* a modern Robinson Crusoe, challenging all nature to battle; but a Robinson Crusoe far stronger and far more certain of victory, because he carried with him all the resources of civilisation.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>As soon as he had put his alidad rule in . position on an improvised surveyor's table, he began to work.</p>

      <p>He need but scrape the lichen—^where it existed—off the mountain ridge whose precipitous formation bore an excellent likeness to the deposited strata of the south, and leave a few horizontal lines darker than the strata themselves. It was no difficult task; the scraper glided over the smooth surface like a scene-painter's brush over a large canvas.</p>

      <p>Every now and then a feeling of self-contempt swept over him for wasting time and energy on these puerilities, but bodily exertion drove the blood into his head so that he saw trifles magnified; he felt like a Titan, storming creation, improving the hieroglyphics of the Creator, turning the axis of the earth so that the south should come a little nearer to the north.</p>

      <p>When he had finished with the striping of the rock—^the whole surface he required was but a few yards in length, as the layers of air would magnify it—^he went on to the manufacture of the stone pine. On the ridge of the rock stood a group of half-grown pine trees which, in the mirages, looked like the edge of a wood. He would have to cut down half a dozen, so as to isolate the most suitable one, the one which stood outlined against the sky.</p>

      <p>To saw off the remainder was the work of half an hour. The one chosen was a slender tree with nothing but a crown of foliage, because the close proximity of the others had prevented the branches from growing lower down the trunk. He had to thin out the crown with his axe, so as to produce the characteristic umbrella formation. It was easily done. But as he examined his creation through the diopter, he found that the style was still not perfect, but that he must wire the uppermost branches and make them stand up, while the side ones would have to be made to droop a little downwards and outwards.</p>

      <p>When the stone pine was finished, he drank a glass of wine and looked round for the raw material out of which to manufacture his cypresses. He soon found it in some cone-shaped junipers of which he had but to select those which were silhouetted against the sky; axe and knife did the rest. But as they looked very light, he dissolved some lamp-black in a bucketful of water and sprinkled them with the mixture, until they had acquired the genuine churchyard tint.</p>

      <p>When he regarded his handiwork, he had misgivings. He remembered the dismal tale of the little girl who trampled on a piece of bread. And when the white sea-gulls began to scream above his head, he thought of the</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>two black ravens who had come down from heaven to carry a soul to hell.</p>

      <p>But after he had rested a little while and the blood had returned to his brain, he smiled at his work and his childish fears. If nature had not been quite as quick in the origination of the species, it had not been for want of will but for want of knowledge.</p>

      <p>He now turned his energies to the marble palace. But as that had been his starting point, and he had carefully thought out the whole matter at home on his sofa, this task was no more difficult than the rest.</p>

      <p>The calcareous deposit was ready to hand and easily manipulated into the fa9ade; there were but a few square yards of it, but that was all that was required; he would merely have to break off the slabs of eurite which the weather had already loosened. The crow-bar was sufficient to begin with, but at the base he had to blast them off with a dynamite cartridge.</p>

      <p>When the shot resounded and the fragments rained down, he realised for an instant the longing of the poet to empty the powder magazines of all the standing armies at once into a volcano, and so deliver humanity from the pain of existence and the troubles of evolution.</p>

      <p>Now the marble slab was laid bare; the crystals of the grainy limestone glittered like the cystals of 4 sugar-loaf in the sunshine. He</p>

      <p>M</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>indicated a rough-hewn base with his paint brush, and drew in two small, square windows. Then he drove two poles into the rock and tied a third across them, so that the whole formed a pergola. All that now remained was to take the shoots of the bear-berry, which were a fathom long, and wind them round the poles, and the vine with its clusters of grapes hanging down in festoons was ready.</p>

      <p>Finally he painted the ground with a weak solution of hydrochloric acid. This produced brilliant spots in the green grass, meant to represent patches of bellis or galanthus, characteristic of the Roman Campagna at the time of the 'second spring,' when the wine harvest was over.</p>

      <p>His task was done. It was evening.</p>

      <p>But to heighten the effect of the miracle, he must also predict its happening, fix the hour when it would be vouchsafed. He knew that the weather had been verj^ hot in Southern Europe, and that therefore a north wind must rise. The wind had been blowing from the east for some time, while the barometrical pressure on the North Sea had been low. According to the reports there was drift ice off Arholma, and as soon as the wind veered a few lines to the north, the ice floes would be compelled to drift with the current which flows westward from Oland, where the Gulf of Both-Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>nia empties into the Baltic. If therefore a northern wind sprang up one of these evenings, it could be safely relied on to last for some days. As this meant a clear atmosphere, he would be in a position to predict the miracle on the day before its happening.</p>

      <p>The hour was but a trifling matter, for a mirage only appears a few hours after sunrise, usually between ten and eleven.</p>

      <p>BoRG was working behind locked doors that night, so as to remain undisturbed and devote the whok evening to his work, his great work which he had planned for the last ten years and hoped to complete when he was fifty years old. It was his great ambition, the purpose that kept him alive, and was guarded jealously like a secret.</p>

      <p>He rejoiced at the thought of being his own master for a few hours, for since the ladies had arrived on the island he had been compelled to spend every evening with them, and what ought to have been rest and recreation had thus become a strain and a tedious routine.</p>

      <p>He loved the girl and was determined to marry her; to live with her in that complete union of body and soul where every hour of leisure is spent in intimate communion. But this state of aflFairs, which was neither marriage nor freedom, but made it incumbent on him to go and see her every day at certain hours and amuse her, whether he felt in the mood or not, irritated him like a duty to be performed at any cost. She clung to him, ever ready to</p>

      <p>180</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>take what he had to give, more especially as he possessed the talent of being always original and entertaining. As, however, he received nothing from her in return, he felt, every now and then, the need of renewing himself. But as soon as he stayed away, she became restless and nervous, subjected him to searching cross-examinations, and wound up by asking him whether she had been too officious, a question which he, as a well-bred man, could not answer in the affirmative.</p>

      <p>He opened a cupboard which contained his manuscripts and a number of cardboard boxes full of notes. These notes were written on small pieces of paper and fastened to half-sheets of foolscap in the way in which a collection of dried plants is arranged; they expressed the thoughts which had occurred to him during his investigations. It amused him to rearrange them again and again according to new methods, in order to determine whether natural phenomena may be arranged in as many ways as a human brain desires, or whether they can be only arranged according to one principle, laid down by nature; in other words whether nature has been working in accordance with a definite law or not.</p>

      <p>This occupation fired him with the idea that it was really he who had reduced chaos to order, he who had separated light and dark-</p>

      <p>Digitized by vjOoqIc ^^p^^</p>

      <p>ness; that chaos had only ceased with the birth of the organ of consciousness, capable of distinguishing between light and darkness when they were still oner The thought intoxicated him; he felt his ego growing, his brain-cells germinating, bursting their seed-coats, multiplying and forming new conceptions which, in due time, should go forth as thoughts and fall as leaven into the brains of strangers; transforming millions of them, if not before, then after his death, into hotbeds for his thought-seeds . . .</p>

      <p>A knock at the door recalled him to reality. Excitedly, as if he had been disturbed at a tryst, he asked who was there ?</p>

      <p>It was a messenger from the ladies, enquiring whether the Superintendent would not come across ?</p>

      <p>He sent a message to say that he had important work to do which would keep him at home unless, indeed, there was a serious reason demanding his presence.</p>

      <p>There was silence for a while. But as he foresaw what would happen, he abandoned the idea of working and began to put away his manuscripts. He had just finished when he heard the old lady coming up his stairs. Instead of waiting for her to knock, he went to the door and threw it wide open.</p>

      <p>'Miss Marie is ill?'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>The mother was taken aback, but immediately recovering her self-possession, she begged him to go and see her daughter, as it was impossible to send for a doctor.</p>

      <p>Borg was not a physician, but he had read elementary pathology and therapeutics and had observed his own symptoms, and those of all sick people who came within his circle of observation; he had pondered on the nature of diseases and remedies and had finished by establishing certain rules of treatment which he adopted in his own case.</p>

      <p>When he was told that Miss Marie had convulsions, he promised to visit her in half an hour and bring some remedies with him.</p>

      <p>It was no difficult matter for him to guess the nature of her malady. It had not been mentioned in the first message, and therefore it must have occurred in the interval between the first and the second; therefore it was the result of his refusal to spend the evening with her and her mother. It was a case of that soul-sickness which he knew so well and which bears the vague name of hysteria. A little pressure on the will; a wish not fulfilled; a plan crossed; and immediately there follows a general malaise, during which the soul attempts to find the cause of the pain in the body, without being able to localise it.</p>

      <p>In the Pharmacodynamics he had often</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>come across cautious little riders bracketted beside the name of a drug, such as 4n a manner not yet known' or *its mode of operation is not exactly known.* Observation and reflection had made it clear to him that because mind and matter are one, the effect of a drug is not only chemico-d3mamic, but also mental. Modem medical science had dropped the remedy, or the material foundation, and adopted, in hypnotism, a merely mental, or in diet and exercise a frequently harmful method. He believed these extremes to be necessary and useful stages of transition, although experiments had demanded many victims : the excitement of many a nervous patient was brought to a still higher pitch by the use of cold water, while a warm bath would have had a calming effect; and weak patients were still further weakened by enforced exercise in inclement weather.</p>

      <p>He held that the old-fashioned remedies had still a value as material for object lessons, popularly speaking, in order to excite certain moods or change existing ones. The group of astringents which effect a contraction of the stomach, also produces a concentration of the scattered forces of the soul. The debilitated drunkard knows this from experience when he winds up his run-down mechanism in the morning with a bitter.</p>

      <p>This girl felt physically ill without in reality being so. He therefore selected a number of drugs, the first of which was calculated to effect a positive disorder which should compel the patient to overcome her soul-sickness and localise her illness in the body. For this purpose he took from his medicine chest a dose of asafetida, that most repugnant of all drugs, well constituted to produce a feeling of general illness, and even convulsions. Her whole bodjs with its senses of smell and taste should rebel against it, and the soul should strain all its functions to eject it.</p>

      <p>This would make her forget her imaginary ailment. It would only be necessary afterwards gradually to mitigate the horror of the first shock, by inducing transition stages, until finally complete absence of distress brought about by a succession of cooling, agreeable and soothing sedatives, would create a feeling of positive pleasure, just as it is delightful to remember dangers and troubles successfully overcome.</p>

      <p>He put on a white cashmere jacket, a cream tie with a faint amethyst stripe, and, for the first time since the arrival of the ladies, he clasped the gold bangle round his wrist. He could not have said why he did so; it was merely a response to a mood assailing him from the sick-bed which he was about to visit.</p>

      <p>When he caught sight of his reflection in the looking-glass, he thought his appearance gentle and sympathetic, as well as striking; apt to attract attention, without unduly exciting a nervous patient.</p>

      <p>Then he collected his requisites like a conjuror who is about to give a performance and went to see the invalid.</p>

      <p>The girl was lying on the sofa. She was wearing a Persian dressing-gown, and her hair was down. Her eyes were wide-open and stared scornfully at the visitor.</p>

      <p>For a moment Borg felt embarrassed, but only for a moment; then he approached the sofa and took her hand in his.</p>

      <p>•What's the matter. Miss Marie V he asked sympathetically.</p>

      <p>She looked at him sharply, as if she wanted to look through and through him, but made no reply.</p>

      <p>He pulled out his watch and examined her pulse. 'You are feverish,' he said.</p>

      <p>It was not true, but he had to win her confidence; it was part of the cure.</p>

      <p>'Feverish! I should think so! I feel as if I were on fire.'</p>

      <p>She had been given a chance to complain and her feeling of enmity against the visitor melted away.</p>

      <p>'If you will promise to obey me, I will cure</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>you/ continued Borg, putting his hand to her forehead.</p>

      <p>At the word obey the patient winced; she evidently had no intention of obeying; but at that very moment the bangle appeared below the cujBF and slipped over the wrist; the resistance of the malade imaginaire ceased.</p>

      <p>*Do as you like with me/ she answered, submissively, gazing with fascinated eyes at the golden snake which seemed to inspire her with a feeling of uneasiness, of fear of something unknown.</p>

      <p>'I'm not a professional physician, as you know,* he continued, 'but I have studied medicine and know quite enough to treat your case. I have a drug here, very unpleasant to take, but which is infallible. I'm no secret-monger and will tell you what it is. It is a resinous sap extracted from the root of a plant which grows in the stony wilds of Arabia.'</p>

      <p>At the word Arabia the girl looked up; perhaps a thought of all the perfumes of Arabia which could never sweeten Lady Macbeth's little hand again crossed her mind.</p>

      <p>She took the spoon in her hand and smelt the contents.</p>

      <p>'I can't!' she exclaimed, shuddering and throwing back her head.</p>

      <p>He gently put his arm round her shoulders and offered her the spoon once again. 'Now,</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>let me see that you are a good girl/ he said encouragingly. And with these words he poured the drug down her throat without her being able to resist.</p>

      <p>She sank back into the sofa cushions, shaking convulsively with disgust which the evil-smelling gum had aroused in her. Her face expressed horror, as if all the evils and abominations of the whole world had been poured down her throat. With a trembling voice she entreated him to give her a drink of water.</p>

      <p>He refused and she had to lie down and abandon herself to the unpleasant sensations caused by the nauseous medicine.</p>

      <p>When he saw that she was almost sick with loathing, he brought out his second drug.</p>

      <p>'Now, Miss Marie,' he said cheerfully, *we have wandered long enough in stony Arabia; we will climb the Alps and drink mountain air, condensed in the bitter, golden root of the health-giving gentian.'</p>

      <p>The unresisting girl swallowed the bitter drug; she started as if she had been stabbed. But immediately afterwards she drew herself up as if strength and energy were flowing back into her soul. The powerful drug, although it irritated the gastric membrane and accelerated her pulse, had taken away the loathsome flavour of the fetid gum.</p>

      <p>'We'll extinguish the fires with these rugs/</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>continued Borg. 'Then we'll travel to the shores of Brittany to fetch the balm of the mild carragheen. Do you feel its soothing e£Eect? Can you sense the sea-breezes?*</p>

      <p>The flushed features of the sufferer relaxed. And as the physician considered her now strong enough to pay attention to his words, he told her stories of his adventures on the coast of Brittany, revived memories of his cruises in the Atlantic, described the life of the fisher-folk of Quimper, and sea-bird shooting at Sarzau.</p>

      <p>She listened to his stories with an air of languid interest. Therefore he suddenly stopped short, and made her take a symphony as he called it. It consisted of the classical rue, well-known to lovers in the Middle-Ages who used it as a spice in their wine, the heavenly angelica, the homely mint, a trace of bennet for the sake of freshness, and a few drops of juniper oil to call up to her mind a picture of the green forest..</p>

      <p>He massaged her soul with moods, made her forget her morbid fancies by taking her, in imagination, from place to place, making her visit the old world and the new; see many countries, many nations, many climates.</p>

      <p>When she seemed tired, he gave her a spoonful of lemon juice with a little sugar, which cooled and soothed her. The simple refresh-</p>

      <p>ing drink seemed so delightful after the terrible half-hour through which she had passed, that a happy smile played round her lips.</p>

      <p>'Turn round to the wall, now,' begged Borg, 'and try to sleep for five minutes while I go and talk to your mother. *</p>

      <p>He was exhausted and longed for a breath of fresh air to restore his vigour. He glanced at the luminous night-sky and the steel-blue sea, closed his eyes and made his mind a blank; and, little by little, order recovered the reins in his confused brain and the latter continued its interrupted movement.</p>

      <p>He stood rigid, half-asleep, with folded arms, plunged in solitude, until he was disturbed by a thought humming in his right ear : 'What a child she is in spite of her thirty-four years.' He roused himself with a start and went back into the cottage.</p>

      <p>Miss Marie was sitting on the sofa, her hair coquettishly arranged round her shoulders, looking the picture of health and young vigour.</p>

      <p>Borg produced from his bag a bottle of wine and a packet of Russian cigarettes.</p>

      <p>'Now you must behave as if you were quite strong again,' he said, 'and as if we had just met after a long separation. And then you must drink a glass of sweet wine from Sicily and smoke a cigarette, for this is part of the cure.'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>The girl seemed to make an efiFort to hide some secret suflFering but she drank the wine while she gazed at the bangle.</p>

      <p>'You are looking at my bangle/ said Borg, breaking the silence.</p>

      <p>*No, I*m not/ replied the girl, denying an obvious fact.</p>

      <p>*It was given to me by a woman who is dead, now, so I could not return it to her. *</p>

      <p>'Have you been in love, then?' asked the girl, sceptically.</p>

      <p>'Yes, I have been in love, but with my eyes wide open! Why should one disregard common-sense when one is about to take the most important step in life, when it is considered praiseworthy under all other circumstances to use it?'</p>

      <p>'Do you mean to say that lovers ought to be calculating?'</p>

      <p>'Certainly ! As calculating as possible, as it is a question of giving rein to one of the most powerful instincts.'</p>

      <p>'Instincts?'</p>

      <p>'Yes, instincts.'</p>

      <p>'Don't you believe in love ?'</p>

      <p>'You are asking me questions to which there is no answer. Do I believe in love, generally speaking ? There are so many kinds of love, and they differ as much from one another as black differs from white. How can I believe in both, in all kinds, at the same time ?'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>'But the highest kind?'</p>

      <p>'The spiritual love! In three storeys, though, like an English house : at the top the study, below the bed-room, and on the ground floor the kitchen.'</p>

      <p>'How practical! But love, the great passion, does not calculate. In my opinion life holds no higher good. I picture it as a storm, a thunderclap, a waterfall! *</p>

      <p>'As a brutal, untamed, natural instinct ? As such it manifests itself in animals and the lower races of mankind . . .'</p>

      <p>'Lower? Aren't all men equals?'</p>

      <p>'Yes, yes! All men resemble one another like eggs. Youths and old men, young men and women, Hottentots and Frenchmen Certainly, they resemble one another I Look at us two ! What is there to differentiate us ? Only the beard. But excuse me now. Miss Marie, I see you are quite yourself again and I must be going. Sleep well! *</p>

      <p>He rose from his chair and seized his hat, but at the next moment the girl was standing by his side. She took his two hands in hers, and entreated him with the same look which had conquered him in the first instance.</p>

      <p>'Stay with me!'</p>

      <p>The burning eyes and the pressure of her hands affected him in the same way in which he believed a young girl to be affected when</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>she is exposed to the ardent attacks of a seducer. He became confused, a feeling of shame, of offended manhood, rebelled against her charm.</p>

      <p>Tull yourself together!' he said, releasing his hands, and an indifference which he was far from feeling made his voice sound cold and cutting.</p>

      <p>*Stay with me or I shall seek you in your room!' was the excited reply which seemed to hold a threat.</p>

      <p>'You'll find my door locked !*</p>

      <p>'Are you a man?'</p>

      <p>*Yes, so much so, that in love I want not only to choose but also to attack. I won't be seduced!'</p>

      <p>He went; and as he closed the door, he heard the fall of a human body and the crash of furniture.</p>

      <p>As soon as he was outside, he was seized by a strong inclination to turn back, for owing to the mental strain which he had just imdergone, he was in a state of weakness which made him very susceptible to the suffering of others.^ But after he had been alone for a few seconds he recovered his self-control; his strength returned and he resolved to sever this connexion which threatened completely to absorb his intellectual life. He must hesitate no longer</p>

She enjoyed the sound of his I voice, but she responded to his ideas only when i they were likely to lead to her own personal ! advantage. He had frequently caught her • scrutinising the lines of his figure; she sometimes, apparently absent-mindedly, clutched his upper arm, the swelling muscles of which formed a ridge under the soft cloth. He thought of her repeated challenges while bathing, sailing, or climbing to the look-out, a spot which he never visited because standing on a height without sufficient protection troubled his nerves. And after her uncontrolled outburst of hysteromania, he realised, with a shrinking, that she did not belong to that more highly evolved race of women, capable of individualising their love, but that he was to her nothing more or less than her indispensable sexual counterpart.</p>

      <p>He walked down to the shore to get cool, but the night was warm; the sea lay before him untroubled; the north-western sky was pale as a melon, but night lay on the water in the east; the boulders were still warm and he sat down in one of those natural chairs carved out of the stone by the frost and polished by the waves.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>He thought of the recent scene. He had calmed down now and saw the matter in another light. It had always been his dieam to win the love of a woman so completely that she should come to him, humbly, and say : 'I love you! deign to bestow on me the splendid gift of your love!' It was in accordance with all the laws of nature that the weaker should com&lt;j to the stronger, in all humility; the reverse was an absurdity, although it was a common practice with all those who still clung to the old superstition that there was a quality of mysticism, of exaltation in every woman. Had it not been proved up to the hilt that her mysticism was but chaos, and her exultation a poetical delusion, created by the unavowed desires of the amorous male ?</p>

      <p>Now she had come to him; he was living his dream. This new woman of a new period, free from all prejudice, had revealed her ardent love to him, and he had rejected her. Why had he done it ? Probably he was still under the ban of conventionality and custom. For there had been nothing shameless in her offer, no trace of the wanton, no imchaste gesture, no lascivious glance. She loved him in her way. What more did he want? With such love he could safely bind himself to her for all life. Surely, not many men could boast of having kindled so transcendent a flame! And</p>

      <p>yet he felt no pride in his victory, for he knew his own value. Rather he felt a heavy responsibility which he would fain shake ofiE. He resolved on flight.</p>

      <p>In imagination he packed his boxes; he stripped his writing-table of all his instruments, all the shining, glittering trifles, until there was nothing left but the plain green cloth. He took away the lamp which had radiated light in the night and colour in the day-time. There was an empty space. He divested the walls of their pictures, their hangings, and the white, dismal, mathematical spaces became apparent. He removed the books from the shelves and the terrible blanks yawned in his face. Monotony, barrenness, poverty!</p>

      <p>He was overcome with physical fatigue; fear of the journey, of the unknown which lay before him, paralysed him; the breaking of his habits, the want of her society troubled him. In imagination he beheld her exquisite beauty, at once childlike and stately; he heard her plaints, noticed her pallid cheeks which, doubtless would blush again under the kisses of some other lover.</p>

      <p>He had been suffering all the sorrows of a separation for a quarter of an hour, which seemed to him a long stretch of endless, grey time, when he noticed, in the dusk of the sum-</p>

      <p>met night, a woman's figure on the ridge of the mountain, clearly outlined against the pale sky. The beautiful proportions of the figure, which he knew so well, looked nobler, statelier, seen against the light, yellow cloud which left it uncertain whether it was irradiated by the last rays of the setting sun, or the first shafts of simrise. The figure had come, to all appearance from the little custom house, and seemed to be looking for something or someone. Her head was uncovered and her hair still flowed down her back.</p>

      <p>She turned her head quickly in all directions; suddenly she seemed to have discovered what she sought. With quick steps she hurried down to the shore where the object of her search was sitting, motionless, without strength to fly, or power to call out to her.</p>

      <p>When she had reached him she knelt down by his side, put her head on his knees and stammered words, wildly, shyly, entreatingly, as if she were dying with shame and yet could not stop her tongue from uttering her heartbroken appeal.</p>

      <p>*Don't leave me,' she sobbed. 'Despise me, if you must, but don*t go away! Love me, love me, or you'll drive me to that place from whence there is no return.'</p>

      <p>yearning for love quickened his heart-beat. But the sight of the kneeling woman also aroused in him the inherited chivalry of the man who looks upon his wife as his mistress and not his slave. He jumped up, drew her into his arms and pressed her against him.</p>

      <p>'Side by side, Marie,* he said, 'not at my feet. You love me because you know that I love you, and now you are mine for all time. 1*11 never let you out of my arms again while there is life in both of us! Do you hear that; You are mine for the whole long life! I will set you upon a throne and give you power over me and all that is mine, my name, my property, my honour and my work! But if you shotdd ever forget that it was I who gave you the power, or if you misuse it, I shall overthrow you as one overthrows a tyrant; I shall fling you into an abyss so profound that you will never again see the sunshine! But that will never happen, for you love me; you do love me, don't you, my beloved ?*</p>

      <p>He had seated her in the rock-chair and was kneeling befor her, his head in her lap.</p>

      <p>'I lay my head in your lap,* he continued, 'don't cut ofiE my hair while I sleep in your arms! Let me lift you up to me, don't drag me down ! Be better than I am, you can, for T shall protect you from all contact with the squalor and misery of the world into which I</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>must go! Let the great virtues which I lack ennoble you; then we shall be a perfect whole.'</p>

      <p>His emotion was beginning to take on the sober colour of thought; he seemed to be wanting to subdue her excitement. But she interrupted him by pressing her flaming cheeks against his. As he did not respond to her caress, she pressed a passionate kiss on his lips.</p>

      <p>'You child,* she said, 'don't you dare to kiss me, even though no one can see us?'</p>

      <p>At her words he sprang up, threw his arms round her and repeatedly kissed her on her slender throat, until she released herself and stood before him, laughing.</p>

      <p>'You little savage!' she scolded.</p>

      <p>'The savage is near enough ! Beware!' he replied, and again took her into his arms.</p>

      <p>They strolled along the warm, soft sand, which whispered round their feet.</p>

      <p>They saw the flashes of the distant lighthouse, for the air was cooler now and the dew had fallen. They heard the bellowing of the seals on the cliffs outside; it sounded like the clamour of a shipwreck.</p>

      <p>They walked about for an hour, several hours, talking of their first meeting, their secret thoughts, the future, the coming winter, proposing some trips abroad.</p>

      <p>In the meantime they had reached the pro-</p>

      <p>'Vestman and his sister-in-law,' said Borg. *If I were her husband I should drown her.'</p>

      <p>'And let him go scot free?' replied the girl, more sharply than she intended.</p>

      <p>'He's not married,' replied Borg curtly. 'That makes a difference.'</p>

      <p>A silence followed, an embarrassing silence, during which they tried to think of a subject of conversation. And all the while common-sense, having cast off the spell, whispered and whispered. He longed for the ecstasy, the intoxication, which shut out reality, transformed greyness into rose-colour, built pedestals, painted cracked china with golden edges.</p>

The wind which had been asleep was waking up; the em-barrassed lover felt its freshness; it was the expected north-wind, which he greeted now as a saviour. The girl's opposition on a vital point had destroyed an illusion. He felt that though they were forged together, their two minds would never fuse into one unless, indeed, he gave way to her. He seized the opportunity to rise without trampling on her.</p>

      <p>'Why do the natives hate me?' he asked, a-propos of nothing.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>'Because you are above them.' The girl had said it almost in spite of herself, without realising what she was admitting.</p>

      <p>'I don't agree with you/ he replied. 'They are not clever enough to realise that.'</p>

      <p>'Hatred might blind their eyes.'</p>

      <p>'Well answered ! But if they saw a miracle, would their eyes be opened ?'</p>

      <p>'Perhaps ! If the miracle inspired awe!'</p>

      <p>'They shall have their miracle! To-morrow at ten, the miracle shall be vouchsafed to them!'</p>

      <p>'What miracle?'</p>

      <p>'The miracle I promised you.'</p>

      <p>The girl looked at him, startled, unwilling to believe her ears.</p>

      <p>'But supposing the sky were overcast?' she laughed.</p>

      <p>'It won't *be,' replied Borg, confidently. 'But since we have already arrived at discussing the weather, we might begin to wonder what your mother will say.'</p>

      <p>'She won't interfere,' answered Marie, promptly.</p>

      <p>'Strange! Can a mother be indifiEerent to her daughter's marriage? Indifferent as to the man whose name she is going to bear ?'</p>

      <p>'Good night,' said Marie, holding up her lips to be kissed. 'You'll come to-morrow morning, won't you?*</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>^Certainly,* he said, *I shall certainly come/</p>

      <p>And she went.</p>

      <p>He remained rooted to the ground and watched her slender figure, sharply silhouetted against the now sulphurous looking cloud, as she ascended the hill. When she arrived at the top she turned round and threw him a kiss. Then the dipping ground gradually swallowed her up until only her head was visible and her long hair floating in the north-wind.</p>

      <p>On the following morning as Borg, who had been accepted as son-in-law without much ado, was sitting at breakfast with his fiancee, his mind was again a prey to the old complex sensation : his admission into this small circle, the members of which were boimd together by mutual interests, filled his heart with a great peace, but at the same time he was conscious of a secret fear of being compelled to allow his individuality to be swamped by the flood of considerations, imposed upon him by sympathy and relationship.</p>

      <p>The events of last night had crashed into his life like a thunderstorm, mingling and intermingling the great things and the small which life had to offer. But instead of meeting the climax of his love affair with his eyes wide open, as he had meant to do, he had deliberately blindfolded himself. He had shut his eyes to the girl's pretended or imaginary indisposition; closed them so tightly that he had induced himself to take her malady seriously.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>If he had not done so, if he had said to her 'Get up f You're all right; you're only imagining that you're ill,* she would have hated him and his object would have been foiled. Now he had won her love, perhaps because she believed that she had deceived him. Therefore his love stood in direct relation to his credulity. And as now, in the clear light of the morning, again and again he asked himself the question : 'Have I any faith in Marie ?* his invigorated common-sense translated it into: *Am I sure that I can always deceive her?' No, there was no such thing as love with open eyes; candour would never win a woman's heart; to speak to her frankly, without reserve, would be to repulse her. He had begun with a lie, he must continue to dissemble.</p>

      <p>But there was no time for brooding whik conversation see-sawed between trifles and outbursts of emotion. The feeling of well-being which he experienced in this home, in the society of these two women, made life so easy and luxurious, that he willingly gave himself up to the pleasure of being his mother-in-law's prot6g6, her boy, her little son. But it did not escape him that the daughter, who was head and shoulders taller than her mother, treated the latter like a child, and by a slight commutation gradually began to feel herself above a man who called one of her kind</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>mother-in-law. But this overthrow of the natural order of things amused him; he had in his mind the picture of the giant who allows the child to pull three hairs out of his beard, but only three.</p>

      <p>As they were sitting over breakfast, gossiping, they suddenly became aware of a confused murmur of voices and, looking through the window, they saw a crowd of fisherfolk standing on the breakwaters. Now they stood motionless, shading their eyes with their hands, now they jumped from one foot to the other, as if the ground were red-hot, or as if they were too excited to stand still for a moment.</p>

      <p>*The miracle!' exclaimed the girl, running out of the room, followed by her mother and her fianc6.</p>

      <p>When they had arrived on the top of the hill the women stood still, as if paralysed by terror, for in the fulness of the radiant summer morning they gazed at a pallid, colossal moon, hanging over a churchyard with black cypresses, which swam on the surface of the sea.</p>

      <p>The Superintendent of Fisheries who had not considered the effect of the mirage from tl;iis point of observation, did not at once grasp the connexion, but the shock of iso enormous and unexpected a hazard befalling law-abiding nature, made him turn deadly pale. He ran</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>past the two ladies who stood on the hill, petrified and motionless, and joined the throng gathered on the shore. Then the solution of the riddle occurred to him in a flash. His fictitious marble palace was framed, against his intention, on one side by a jutting, bulging wall of rock, and on the other by the crown of a pine tree. This gave the marble slab the shape of a disk and, with its too-faintly indicated windows it bore quite a good resemblance to the map of the moon.</p>

      <p>The people had been informed that the miracle would happen at the appointed hour, according to the promise given by the Superintendent. They were staring at the moon in terrified but awed silence and, against their custom, took their hats and caps off as Borg joined them.</p>

      <p>*Well, what do you thing of my mirage?' asked the latter, cheerfully.</p>

      <p>Nobody answered. But the chief pilot, more courageous than the rest, pointed in the direction of the north-west, where the pale new moon hung in the morning sky.</p>

      <p>The effect of the miracle had been paralysing, and the strong impression produced by the two moons was not to be effaced by an explanation. When the Superintendent made an attempt to enlighten the crowd, he found that his words received no attention; the people</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>stood there, bewildered and over-awed, as if they were in love with their terror of the inexplicable. Borg gave up all efforts to shake their faith. He had wanted to give them a proof that neither he, not nature herself, is able to break eternal laws, and accident had made a magician of him.</p>

      <p>As he turned round he saw that his fianc6e was in a state of exaltation, while her mother was trying to hold her back. When he approached her, she released herself from her mother's grip, fell on her knees, and with frenzied gestures addressed him in phrases evidently borrowed from spiritistic circles :</p>

      <p>^Mighty spirit, we are afraid of thee! Take fear away from our hearts that we may love thee!'</p>

      <p>T]je matter was becoming more and more serious, and Borg summoned all his powers to explain the undesired miracle; in vain. The enjoyment of being mystified, the paralysis of fear, a lurking sense of honour unwilling to admit the deception, had so taken possession of her that all explanations and protestations were spoken to the wind.</p>

      <p>The mother with her imperturbable, calm indifference, did not seem to know what to make of it all; she had forgotten the phenomenon in the alarming conduct of her daughter.</p>

      <p>Marie's words and gestures drew the atten-</p>

      <p>tion of the people on the shore from the mirage to Borg. When the natives saw the yonng woman kneeling before the white-clad man with the profound black eyes, some vague reminiscence of a young man who did miracles stirred their minds. They gathered in a group and whispered among themselves.</p>

      <p>Encouraged by the chief pilot, one of the women ran into the nearest cottage and returned with a three-year old child, whose cheek was disfigured by a festering wound.</p>

      <p>Apparently they connected with the ability to create a mirage a supernatural power of healing the sick.</p>

      <p>The part which Borg was now forced to play was distasteful to him beyond words. When he saw that fishermen, pilots and customs ofiicials forsook their work, carpenters and joiners left their job, to stand and listen to his words, as if they were prophecies and had miraculous power, he began to be afraid of a force of nature which he had evoked but could not master. However, the moment had come when he must speak his mind clearly and plainly.</p>

      <p>*Good people,* he began, and hesitated; how was he to begin? What language was he to use? Every term required an explanation demanding knowledge which they did not possess. During those few moments in which he</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>mentall}^ stared at the chasm which separated him from them, he heard footsteps and, turning round, beheld a man who looked like an elderly sailor on leave.</p>

      <p>The man raised his slouched felt hat; he seemed despondent and embarrassed; but when he came nearer he drew himself up and was about to venture a remark, when Borg came to his rescue:</p>

      <p>*Are you the preacher whom we are expect' ing from the Foundation?* he asked.</p>

      <p>'Yes,' answered the ne^^comer.</p>

      <p>'Then I wish you woidd ^^y a few words to these people who are perturbed by a natural phenomenon, which they don*t wish to have explained, and which I can't elucidate in a few moments,' said Borg, eager to extricate himself from a false position.</p>

      <p>The preacher acquiesced. He stroked his long imperial and took a bible out of his pocket.</p>

      <p>A movement went through the crowd as the people caught sight of the volume, bound in black, and some of the men bared their heads.</p>

      <p>The preacher turned over the leaves for a little while, but finally he stopped, cleared his throat and began to read :</p>

      <p>'And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was a great earth-quake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>hair, and the moon became as blood. And the stars of heaven fell nnto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind. And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places! And the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains, and the mighty men and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the motmtains; and said to the mountains and rocks : Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb : for the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand ?'</p>

      <p>Borg, realising at once the critical turn matters had taken, drew his fianc6e, half by force, away from the dangerous proximity of the preacher. He led her down to the shore, intending to show her, by placing her at the right point of observation, that the vision she. had seen was no moon fallen out of the sky, but only the Italian landscape which he had promised her as a birthday present.</p>

      <p>But it was too late. The girl's inner eye had taken hold of the vision in its first shape, and the preacher's thrilling explanation had burnt it still deeper into her consciousness. Borg had played with elemental^, had called</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>up a foe to his assistance; now all had gone over to the enemy and he stood alone.</p>

      <p>While Marie's eyes were still rivetted on the preacher on the mountain, he tried to enlist the mother's help.</p>

      <p>•Help me out of this,' he whispered. 'Come with us to the Swordholm and see for yourself that it is nothing but play, a birthday jest.'</p>

      <p>*I can't and I won't express an opinion in these matters,' replied the old woman. 'But I believe—you had better get married soon.'</p>

      <p>It was a sober and prosaic counsel, but from, the lips of the old woman, a mother, it sounded shrewd and intelligent; moreover, it was in keeping with the promptings of his own common-sense. He went back to the girl, threw his arms round her, looked into her eyes with a smile which she could not fail to understand, and kissed her on the lips.</p>

      <p>His kiss broke the spell which the man on the mountain had woven round her; she took her fianc6's arm, and with dancing footsteps returned with him to her mother's cottage.</p>

      <p>'Thank you,' she whispered, gazing into his eyes, 'thank you for—^how shall I say it ?'</p>

      <p>*Por having delivered you from the mountain-ogre,' suggested Borg.</p>

      <p>'Yes, from the ogre..'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>And she turned round to look at the danger which she had escaped.</p>

      <p>'Don't look back!' warned her lover and drew her into the cottage, while the wind carried down to him a few stray woi:ds from the preacher's sermon.</p>

      <h1 id="c12h01">CHAPTER XII</h1>

      <p>One morning, a week later, as the superintendent awoke from a long, refreshing sleep, his first clear thought was that he must leave the island and find a refuge where he could be alone, collect his thoughts, come to himself again. The arrival of the preacher had had the desired eflFect in one direction, it had *put a check on the mob'; the noise, the brutalities, had ceased. But, on the other hand, Borg was imable to enjoy the newly won peace, for his fiancee's excited state of mind did not permit him to lose sight of her for a moment.</p>

      <p>During this last week he had beei^ with her all day long, guarding her from morning till night, attempting, by endless discussions on religion, to break the spell which the preacher's seductive sermons were weaving round her. He seemed to be fighting the struggles of his adolescence over again, only, as fresh evidence had been discovered since then, he had to re-edit his whole defence. He improvised, as he went along, new explanations of God, faith, miracles, eternity, prayer.</p>

      <p>lit</p>

      <p>imagining all the time that the girl understood him.</p>

      <p>But when, after three days, she had not budged from her position, he was compelled to admit that this matter of emotion lay outside common-sense; he changed his tactics and endeavoured by awakening the erotic element, to drive out one emotion by another.</p>

      <p>But he soon fotmd that this was a mistake; the discussion of the future and what it held in store for them merely intensified the girl's emotional life. He soon discovered the secret bridges which span religious ecstasy and the intoxication of the senses.</p>

      <p>It was an easy way from the love of Christ to the love of a human man across the wide draw-bridge of neighbourly love; from chastity to resignation across the foot-path of mortification of the senses. A little teasing was followed by the unpleasant feeling of contrition which had to be dissipated by the delightful sensation of a reconciliation.</p>

      <p>In his despair he decided to break away the bridges, place her face to face with brutal lust, rouse in her a longing for things temporal which he painted to her in glowing colours.</p>

      <p>But when the successful exponent drew back at the last moment, her heart was chilled with disappointment. And when he attempted to give her emotions a loftier content by guiding</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>hfer thoughts to the subject of a famUy and children, she recoiled, terrified, and declared that she wanted no children, silencing him with what was then a favourite formula with a certain group of women: she declined to become the mother of his children, declined to bear his offspring, and bring them into the world at the risk of her own life.</p>

      <p>This made him realise that nature had erected a barrier between them of which he knew nothing; but he found a grain of comfort in the thought that it was perhaps only the fear of the butterfly to lay its egg and die; the foreboding of the flower that the formation of seed meant the destruction of its beauty.</p>

      <p>He had exhausted himself during this week; the delicate wheels of his thoughts had stopped in their bearings-and the mainspring of the mechanism had become slack.</p>

      <p>If, on the day after a discussion of this kind he attempted to do a few hours' work, he found that his head was filled with nonsense; futile remarks were repeated almost audibly before his ears; his memory reproduced the gestures and facial expressions which he had used during a dispute; he thought of answers which he might have made; the memory of a pertinent reply gave him a moment's pleasure. It was evident he thought of nothing but trifles.</p>

      <p>He realised, now, that he had attempted to</p>

      <p>Digitized</p>

      <p>.yGoogle^^^</p>

      <p>reduce chaos to order; he had been talking to a school-boy believing himself to be all the time exchanging thoughts with a mature woman; he had spent a vast amount of power without receiving anj^hing in return. He had put a sponge into his soul, and the soul was sucked dry.</p>

      <p>He was sick of it all; he longed to leave her, for a time at least. To give her up entirely was out of the question.</p>

      <p>As he was looking out of the window, at five o'clock in the morning, he gazed at a dense wall of mist, immovable in spite of the faint south wind. The light, a delicate, white darkness, attracted instead of repelling him; it would hide and remove him from this small part of the globe to which he was fettered.</p>

      <p>Barometer and weather-cock promised sunshine for later on. Therefore he took out his boat, making no preparations, but merely providing himself with sea-chart and compass. Even these were almost unnecessary, for he could hear the bell of a buoy, half a mile off, in the direction of the spot where he intended to land.</p>

      <p>/He hoisted the sail and was soon shrouded in fog. Here, where the eye was not subjected to impressions of shape and colour, he realised to the full the pleasure of being detached from the ever-changing outer world He was sur-</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>rounded, as it were, by his own atmosphere. He glided along, alone as if he were on another star, in a medium which was not air but a watery vapour, far more pleasant and refreshing to breathe than the parching air with its unnecessary seventy-five per cent, of nitrogen which, for no conceivable object, had remained over when the mass of the earth had been formed out of the gaseous chaos.</p>

      <p>It was no dark, murky fog, but a light mist, resembling liquid silver, enriching the sunlight. Warm and soft as cotton wool, it enfolded his bruised soul, protecting it from blow and pressure. For a moment he enjoyed this waking rest of the senses, soundless, colourless, without smell. The certainty that he would not come into contact with others refreshed his tormented soul. He would not be tortured by questions; he need not reply, need not talk. The apparatus stood still for a moment. He was perfectly insulated.</p>

      <p>But soon he began to think again, clear, consecutive thoughts. In imagination he once more lived through the last few weeks; it was all so petty, so small, that he had to get rid of it before he could open his mind to new impressions.</p>

      <p>He heard the warning bell in the distance, at intervals of a few minutes, and, guided by the sound, he steered a course straight into the fog.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>Once more the world was plunged in silence; only the plashing of the waves at the bow and the boiling of the waters in the wake showed that he was moving. Then a sea-gull screamed in the mist, and at the same moment he fancied that he heard the splashing of a boat behind him. When he hailed her, however, fearful of an accident, he received no answer, but he could tell from the sound of the water that she was standing oS.</p>

      <p>A little later on his attention was caught by the top of a mast with mainsail and topsail appearing on the weather side; but neither the hulk of the ship nor the steersman were visible, as both were hidden by the swell.</p>

      <p>The incident would not have troubled him at any other time; but now it impressed him, as things inexplicable at the moment do impress the mind, and often even rouse a vague sense of fear, from which it is but a step to the conviction that one is being pursued. His distrust quickened as, directly after, the phantom ship, looking as if she had been painted on the fog&gt; passed him under the ke, without his being able to catch a glimpse of the steersman who was concealed by the sprit sail.</p>

      <p>He hailed her again; but instead of a reply the boat veered, sufficiently to allow him to see that the helm was deserted. And immediately after she was swallowed up again by the all-eSacing fog.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>Borg, who did not know what fear of the unknown meant, tried to think of an explanation, but was unable to solve the riddle. Why did the steersman hide himself ? For it went without saying that a sailing boat which was not adrift must carry a steersman on board. Why did he not want to be seen ? As a rule there are three reasons which induce a man to go into hiding: he may have committed a crime, he may want to be left in peace, or he may want to strike fear into the heart of a fellow-creature. That the unknown sailor was not seeking solitude was obvious, as he steered the same course, and if it was his object to frighten a man who knew no fear, he should have hit on a better plan.</p>

      <p>Borg continued on his tack while the phantom ship followed obstinately under his lee, at a distance which gave her the appearance of a patch of condensed mist.</p>

      <p>As soon as the wind freshened the fog lifted a little. The sunlight, turned into silver by the mist, lay on the waves like a huge argent bar. With the increasing wind the warning from the buoy became more frequent.</p>

      <p>Now he steered straight into the sunlight, where the wall of fog was riven, and made fast headway in the direction of the buoy.</p>

      <p>There it lay before him, dancing and rocking on the waves, scarlet and shining wet,</p>

      <p>220 BY THE OPEN SEA</p>

      <p>looking like a lung with its large, black windpipe slanting upwards. Presently, as a wave compressed the air, it gave a snort, as if the sea were bellowing to the sun. The ground chain rattled until it had run off, and as the wave subsided, sucking back the air, a roar arose from the deeps that might have come from the gigantic mouth of a mastodon.</p>

      <p>It was the first exhibition of power and strength coming after a month of puerilities and trifling.</p>

      <p>He was forced to admire the human genius who had attached a bell to the treacherous wolf, the sea, forcing it to warn its defenceless victims. He envied this hermit fettered to a cliff in the middle of the ocean, vieing day and night with wind and wave in bellowing, so that it could be heard miles off; its voice was the first to welcome the stranger; its groan of agony the only one which fell on germane ears.</p>

      <p>The brief spell of i^unshine was soon over. Semi-darkness again enfolded the boat which now stood off and then steered a course to the skerry where Borg intended to rest for a little while. He stood for half an hour on the same tack until he could hear the surge beating on the shore; he veered to get under the lee, and a few moments later the boat shot into a little bay which he could use as a harbour.</p>

      <p>It was the most distant skerry beyond the</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>entrance. It consisted of a few acres, of red gneiss and boasted no vegetation with the exception of a little lichen on those spots not scraped clean by the drift ice. It served as a resting place for various species of sea-gulls which screamed as Borg moored his boat and climbed to the ridge. There he wrapped his rug round him and sat down in a well polished cleft which formed a comfortable easy chair.</p>

      <p>Here, without witnesses, without an audience, he gave rein to his thoughts; he confessed to himself, examined his inmost mind and listened to his inner voice.,. For two months only he had been in contact with his own kind and already, by the law of adaptation, he had lost the best part of himself. He had fallen into the habit of agreeing with others so as to avoid quarrelling; he had made a practice of bending that he might not be broken; he had developed into a glib, unprincipled man of the world, completely given up to trifles; compelled to speak an abbreviated, simplified language, he felt that in the gamut of his vocabulary the semi-tones had been lost, that his thoughts were nmning in old well-worn ruts which always led back to the starting-point. Old axioms, that one should respect the faith of others, for instance, or that everybody should be allowed to be happy in his own way, had crept back into his mind. The de-</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>sire to please had induced him to play the magician and had reached its climax when he had saddled himself with a dangerous rival who threatened to rob him at any moment of the only human soul which he yearned to bind to his own.</p>

      <p>He smiled at the thought of how he had been all along deceiving those who believed that they were deceiving him. But a half-audible, involuntary: 'You fools!' made him start, afraid lest somebody had overheard him.</p>

      <p>Once more he relapsed into his reverie and the silent thoughts came and went. They believed that they had imprisoned his soul, and he had bound them, hand and foot. They fancied that he was doing their bidding, and did not know that he was making use of them to gauge the power of his soul and glory in his strength.</p>

      <p>These thoughts which, up to the present, he had kept at arm's length, now greeted him as the children of his soul; big, healthy children they were; he would no longer disown them. What had he done but wl.at his foes woidd do if they had the ability! And this girl, who imagined that she could play on him as on a barrel organ, for her amusement, never suspected that he had chosen her to become the sounding board of his sovd . . .</p>

      <p>The current of his thoughts ceased to flow;</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>he jumped up; he had distinctly heard footsteps on the rocks. While admitting the possibility of an auditory deception, produced by solitude and the fear of being taken by surprise, he thought it wise to go down to the shore and have a look at his boat. When he found it imdisturbed, he resolved to walk round the skerry and search for the other boat, for another boat there must be if anybody beside himself was on the island.</p>

      <p>He walked across the boulders on the shore and soon found under the lee of the nearest promontory a flat boat with a sprit sail and rigging resembling in every detail the one which he had met outside. Doubtless the sailor was on the skerry !</p>

      <p>Borg dived into the fog, careful to keep within the vicinity of the boats so as to cut ofiF the intruder's retreat. But after repeatedly shouting in vain, he came to the conclusion that It he wanted to catch the mysterious stranger, he must leave the boats to their fate. He removed the tillers, so as to make flight impossible, and a few moments later he was again lost in the fog. For a little while he followed the footsteps which he could plainly hear in front of him; but before long they seemed to come from the opposite direction. Tired with his exertion, and irritated by his unsuccessful eflForts, he resolved to put an end</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC ^^^^^</p>

      <p>* _. J</p>

      <p>to the chase at once, without waiting for tha lifting of the fog.</p>

      <p>'If anybody is here, answer!' he shouted, 'I'm going to shoot!'</p>

      <p>'For the Lord Jesus' sake, don't!' came a voice out of the fog.</p>

      <p>It seemed to Borg that he had heard the voice before, but it must have been a long time ago, perhaps in the days of his boyhood. As he approached the spot where the stranger was standing, and noticed his silhouette against the wall of mist, the outlines seemed to be familiar to him. Knock-kneed, with arms which were far too long, and a deformed left shoulder, the figure had its companion on the tablets of his memory in the portrait of a school-fellow, a boy whom he knew in the third class of the preparatory school. But when the preacher's American beard appeared out of the fog, the connexion between the two pictured was broken, and'he saw only the man on the mountain who had applied the Revelation of St. John to his mirage.</p>

      <p>Hat in hand, his face blanched with fear, the itinerant preacher approached the Superintendent who felt an3^hing but pleased with the company of this sneaking pursuer, for his threat of shooting had been bluff and he carried .no gim with him. He addressed him sharply, to conceal his uneasiness ;</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>'Why are you hiding from me?'</p>

      <p>*I'm not hiding; the fog has hidden me/ answered the preacher in a soft, conciliatory voice.</p>

      <p>*But why were you not at the helm ?'</p>

      <p>*Why should a man be compelled to sit at the helm? I was sitting at the weather side so that the boat should sail with greater ease. I had fastened a rope to the tiller, as it is customary in my country.'</p>

      <p>The explanations were unexceptionable, although they threw no light on the question as to why he had followed the superintendent to this lonely spot. The latter foresaw the imminency of a hand-to-hand fight of souls, for they had not been brought together by accident.</p>

      <p>*What are you doing out here at this early hour?' he recommenced, taking up the broken thread.</p>

      <p>*I hardly know how to tell you. I have at times a strong yearning to be alone.*</p>

      <p>This reply found an echo in the heart of the questioner, and the preacher, who read a certain amount of sympathy in Borg's face, added : 'You see, whenever T try to find myself in meditation and prayer, and succeed, I find my God also.' There was a naive confession in these words;</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>but Borg did not want to point out the ininten-tional heresy and draw the conclusion :. 'God is therefore myself/ or: 'God is merged in me.' He felt a certain respect for this man who could "share solitude, with a,fiction or, in other words, be alone with himself.</p>

      <p>But while he was scrutinising the preacher's face which, with the exception of the upper lip, was covered by a long, brown beard, a fashion common among sailors and itinerant preachers—perhaps so as to allow a clear enunciation of the spoken word and at the same time preserve an apostolic appearance—^he had an intuition that what he saw was a mask, covering a face which he knew. Tormented by a nagging memory, he blurted out a straight question :</p>

      <p>'Haven't we met before?'</p>

      <p>•Yes,' answered the preacher. 'And you, Mr Superintendent, have, possibly without knowing it, exerted so great an influence on my life, that I may almost say you have shaped my career. *</p>

      <p>'Have I really? Tell me all about it then, for my mind is a blank,' begged Borg, reseating himself on the rock and inviting the other man to sit down by his side.</p>

      <p>'It must be about twenty-five years since we were lads together in the third class . . .'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>'What was your name in those days ?'</p>

      <p>'My name was Olsson; I was called Olox, because my father was a peasant and I wore homespun clothes.*</p>

      <p>'Olsson ? Wait a second ! You were first in arithmetic?'</p>

      <p>'Quite so!—One day, it was the headmaster's fiftieth birthday—^we had decorated the whole school with flowers and foliage. After lessons somebody proposed that the boys of the third class should take the flowers to the head-master's wife and daughter. I remember that you objected because, you said, the head-master's ladies had nothing whatever to do with the school, although they frequently interfered. Nevertheless, you went along with the rest, and so did I. As I was walking upstairs you noticed my home-made clothes, I suppose, and also that I was carrying the finest bouquet. And you exclaimed in a loud voice : "Is Saul also among the prophets ?" '</p>

      <p>'I remember nothing about it,' replied Borg, curtly.</p>

      <p>'But I have never forgotten it,' continued the preacher, and his voice shook. 'You were telling me then, straight to my face, that I was the black sheep, the intruder, whose attention to a lady of position could only be regarded as a joke. I left school and went to business</p>

      <p>thinking that I should be able to earn money, buy well-cut clothes, acquire good manners and the art of expressing myself well. But my appearance, my accent, my breeding were against me. I shut myself up; but the more aloof I kept from my fellow-men, the more I felt that I possessed unsuspected powers. In my boyish enthusiasm I had chosen the church as my profession; it was too late now. Solitude begot in me a dread of my fellow-men, and the dread of men made me more lonely; so lonely that I was driven to seek my only friend in God and in the Saviour of the neglected, the black sheep, the Cains of the earth, our Lord Jesus Christ! I have to thank you for that!'</p>

      <p>The last words were spoken with so much--bitterness that Borg decided to be quite frank with the preacher.</p>

      <p>*And so you have hated me all these twenty-five years!' he exclaimed.</p>

      <p>'Unspeakably! But I have left vengeance to God, and I hate you no longer.'</p>

      <p>'Your God is a God of vengeance, then I Do you think that he will choose you as his instrument? Or do you think that he will strike me down with his electric spark? Or that he will blow my boat to the bottom of the sea ? Or afflict me with small«p(?.x ?*</p>

      <p>*The Z^cd's ways are secret, but the ways of the unrighteous are known to all men!'</p>

      <p>'Can a school-boy's foolish words be so un-righteous an act in the sight of God that He will persecute him all his life? I wonder whether this God of vengeance does not dwell in your own heart, where you meet him every now and then, as you said a little while ago V</p>

      <p>Caught in the snare of his own words, the preacher was no longer able to control his temper.</p>

      <p>*Go on! Blaspheme!' he shouted. 'Like father, like son! Now I understand all the wiles of Satan. You are building a house for the Lord to please a wanton. You play the conjuror and magician, so that the people shall fall down and worship the infidel! But the Lord saith : Blessed are those who wash their robes, for they shall approach the tree of life and enter through the gates of the town. But there shall remain outside all dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and those who serve false gods and those whose tongue utters lies!'</p>

      <p>Those words had poured from his lips with incredible volubility and excitement. Then he turned round as if afraid of a pertinent reply which would weaken their eflFect, and went down to the shore to find his boat.</p>

      <p>In the meantime the fog had lifted, revealing the wide expanse of the pure azure sea, calming and relieving the oppressed spirit.</p>

      <p>Borg lingered a little longer in his rock seat, -y^ meditating on the fact that the soul is subject to the same laws as the body.</p>

      <p>The wind whips up a wave at Esthland; wave chases wave until the last of them, the one which breaks on the coast of Sweden, loosens a tiny pebble which supports a boulder. Years may pass before the law of cause and eflEect is once more borne out, but eventually the rock will totter and fall and be engulfed by the ocean; and this, again, will begin the imdermining of the clifiE which has been laid bare.</p>

      <p>Twenty-five years ago his lips had flung forth a word meaningless to him. The word had penetrated through the ear into the brain of a stranger and had set it in motion so violently that it still trembled, after having influenced a man's career through a whole life-time.</p>

      <p>Who could tell whether this innervation current had not been strengthened by contact and friction to such a degree that it would again discharge itself with increased power, and set in motion forces which would shake and ruin the lives of others ?</p>

      <p>As the preacher's boat rounded the headland</p>

      <p>and steered a course to the East Skerry, Borg felt so convinced that he had in him an enemy bent on attacking his position, that he arose to unmoor his boat and return home to put himself into a state of defence.</p>

      <h1 id="c13h01">CHAPTER XIII</h1>

      <p>When Borg was reseated in the boat, his spirit calmed by the gentle rocking of the waves, he felt a strong desire to spend a few more hours in complete solitude on the sea and let the summer breeze blow away the distressing of the recent scene.</p>

      <p>' Why should he fear this man's influence on his fiancee ? If the girl could sink to the level of the uncultured, she was no fit mate for him. At the same time, the very fact of his being able to entertain such a doubt pained him. He was behaving like a man who lives in the eternal dread of loss, called by the absurd name jealousy. Was it because he realised his inability to hold her, betraying thereby a weakness in himself ? Or was it not rather a weakness in her, preventing her from exercising the slightest self-control, as soon as it became a question of allowing the balloon to rise, weigh the anchor of religion and throw out the ballast of the emotions ? He felt convinced that the latter was the case.</p>

      <p>He had changed his course and his boat lay</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>now south-east of the skerry. He had never seen his prison from this point. High up, on the ridge of the mountain, stood the skeleton of the unfinished chapel, there were no workmen on the scaffolding, although the morning was far advanced. Not a single fishing boat was on the sea. Deep silence brooded over the island; even the custom house and the pilots' look-out were deserted.</p>

      <p>He stood on another tack, intending to sail roimd the skerry, but outside, beyond the shelter of the land, the sea was rough. He gained little by cruising and it was fully an hour before he could make port. Now he caught a glimpse of the ladies' cottage. As soon as he rounded the point of the harbour, he could see that the whole population was crowding round the little house in whose porch the preacher was standing, bare-headed, delivering a sermon.</p>

      <p>Convinced that he was on the eve of a battle, Borg landed, furled his canvas and went into his room.</p>

      <p>Through the ojjen window came the sound of many voices, singing a hymn.</p>

      <p>He wanted to work, but the conviction that he wotild soon be interrupted, prevented him from beginning.</p>

      <p>A tedious half-hour elapsed during which</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>be realised mare dearly than ever before that be was no longer his own master; that he no longer possessed a few square yards of space where he was safe from intermption and contact with sonls which clung to him as shells cling to the skin of the whale, retarding his speed by their weight.</p>

      <p>There was a short rap, the door opened and Marie entered* Her face bore a new expression, a mixture of pained reproach and the compassion of a superior being. He waited for her to b^in.</p>

      <p>* Where have you been ?' she said, trying to be as little supercilious as she could.</p>

      <p>*IVe been sailing.'</p>

      <p>* Without asking me to come with you ?'</p>

      <p>*I didn't know whether you would care to come?'</p>

      <p>*You did know; but you wanted to be alone with your gloomy thoughts.'</p>

      <p>Terhapsldid.'</p>

      <p>'I'm sure you did ! Do you think I haven't noticed it? Do you think I don't know that you are tired of me ?*</p>

      <p>*You can't say I'm tired of you because— after having been with you day after day—I took the liberty one morning, long before you were up, to go sailing for a few hours. But you've grown tired of fishing; I haven't seen you go out once!'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>'There's no fishing now, as you know,* answered Marie, firmly convinced that she was speaking the truth.</p>

      <p>'No, I see that!' retorted Borg, resolved to approach the mine, even at the risk of an explosion. 'The people have given up work to listen to sermons.'</p>

      <p>The mine exploded.</p>

      <p>* Wasn't it your suggestion to have divine service out here?'</p>

      <p>'Yes, but only on Sundays. A man should work six days and go to church on the seventh. But not a stroke of work is done here during the whole week, and sermons are preached all day long. Instead of providing a comfortable home for themselves and their families here on earth, the men are running after something which is as uncertain as heaven. Even the building of the chapel is stopped, and I don't suppose it will ever be finished. I expect every moment to hear that the people are destitute and require relief . . .'</p>

      <p>'That's just what I wanted to speak about,' interrupted Marie, glad of the opening which Borg had given her, and not at all realising that in so doing he had already disposed of the subject.</p>

      <p>'1 haven't come here to give alms, but to teach the people to help themselves.'</p>

      <p>*You're a callous brute, although you pretend to have a heart!'</p>

      <p>*And you want to parade your kind heart at my cost, without the slightest intention of sacrificing as much as a yard of the trimming of your dress!'</p>

      <p>'I hate you! I hate youT the girl burst out, and a terrible expression distorted her face. *I know who you are, I know all, all, all!'</p>

      <p>'Why don't you throw me over then ?' asked Borg in a cold, steely voice.</p>

      <p>'I shall throw you over! I shall!' She turned towards the door, but changed her mind and stayed.</p>

      <p>Borg sat down at his writing-table, took a pen and began to write, so as to escape the temptation of renewing a discussion which was closed, as everything had been said.</p>

      <p>He heard, as in a dream, a loud sobbing, the closing of a door, steps on the landing and the creaking of the stairs.</p>

      <p>When he roused himself and looked at the paper on which he had been scribbling, he found that the word Pandora was written there so many times that quite a long time must have elapsed since the end of the scene.</p>

      <p>The word impressed him and excited his curiosity. He had forgotten, in the course of</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>/</p>

      <p>BY THE OPEN SEA 237</p>

      <p>the years, who Pandora was, and had but a vague recollection that she was connected with the Greek Deities. He opened his encyclopaedia and read :</p>

      <p>'Pandora, the Eve of the classical age, was sent to the earth by the revengeful gods to punish men for Prometheus' theft of the divine fire. She brought with her all the evils which exist in the world. She is represented in poetry in the guise of a blessing, concealing a dazzling evil; a being built for deceit and irruption. •</p>

      <p>This, like the legend of Eve, who was the cause of man's banishment from Paradise, was mythology. But the legend was confirmed by all ages, and in his own experience the presence of a woman in this tiny part of the globe, out here by the sea, had spread twilight where he had intended to kindle a torch; it was only logical to suppose that profound wisdom was enfolded in the picturesque language of the Greek and Jewish poets.</p>

      <p>She had turned against him; she had proved it by making common cause with the mob. And yet he was reluctant to doubt her love, even though her love was merely the striving of the sun-flower to borrow from the sun the rays of light for a poor reproduction on its yellow disc. But there was also something</p>

      <p>mean in it, something malignant, and the desire to inflict injury. It was a struggle for supremacy, tmjustifiable, because his defeat would mean the triumph of stupidity.</p>

      <p>To tell her so would mean the severing of their relationship. The latter depended on his admission, or at any rate on his acknowledgement of her superior wisdom. Not to tell her so, on the other hand, would mean to build up life on an expedient whose results would grow and expand, and perhaps choke all possibility of an honest understanding. Was not the underlying cause of so many unhappy marriages the fact that most men started their married lives with a sometimes intentional lie ? That they were often deluded, under the force of their desire for a kindred soul, into endowing women with their own qualities? This deception, this second sight, had infatuated Mill to such an extent that he was convinced that the simple woman whom he himself had trained, had inspired him with all his noblest thoughts.</p>

      <p>From time immemorial the price to be paid for love was the obligation on the man's part to withhold his knowledge of woman. On the foundation of this silence the centuries had built a chaos of lies which science had not dared to overthrow; which the boldest states-</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>man had not ventured to touch; for the sake of which theologians denied their Paul, whenever the woman in the community was concerned.</p>

      <p>His love was bom and had burst into flames at the moment when she looked up to him with appealing eyes. His love died when she came to him with the triumphant smile of stupidity, after having trampled down what he had wanted to build up for her happiness and that of many others.</p>

      <p>'Finished,' he murmured, rose from his seat and locked his door.</p>

      <p>Dead was the hope of his youth to find the woman whom he was seeking : the woman who had sufficient brain to acknowledge that her sex was inferior to his.</p>

      <p>It was true, he had occasionally met women who had admitted the fact, without, however, admitting the real cause of it; they had laid the blame on an imaginary oppression and had been convinced that with greater freedom they would soon far outstrip their male competitors.</p>

      <p>And argument had followed argument.</p>

      <p>He was loath to waste his intelligence in an unequal fight with gnats, too small and too numerous to be hit with a stick. No, all should be over and done with; he had sought in vain for what did not exist. All his energy should be devoted to work. He would sup-</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>press his yearning for a family and a home, suppress his sexual instinct and leave propagation to the 'breeding-stock.'</p>

      <p>The feeling of freedom brought peace to his soul. It was as if a clutch had been removed from his brain and the latter could now function without restriction. The thought that he was no longer obliged to study his fiancee's whims in regard to his outward appearance made him remove at once an uncomfortable collar which she considered chic. He arranged his hair in a more natural way and was instantly aware of a soothing influence on his nerves, for the struggle with a style of hair-dressing which she preferred had been a constant source of irritation to him. He brought out his pipe, a dear, old friend, banished at her dictate. Dressing-gown and sandals which he had not dared to wear for many days, gave ease and freedom and the impression that he was living in a more rarified atmosphere, where he could breathe and think without hindrance.</p>

      <p>And now, released from all necessity for adaptation, he realised the full extent of the tyranny under which he had groaned. He could walk about the room without fear of being disturbed by a knock at the door; he could indulge in his thoughts without feeling that he was disloyal.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>He had not enjo5^ed his newly won liberty for long when he was interrupted by a knock at the door. A jerk went through his body as if some of his moorings were still fast. When he heard the voice of Marie's mother, the thought that everything was not finished, that he had to begin again at the beginning, struck him like a blow.</p>

      <p>His first impulse was to keep the door locked, but his sense of what was proper, and fear of being thought a coward, held him back. When he looked into the friendly, intelligent eyes of the old lady, as she entered the room with a kindly smile, and a humorous shake of the head, the last half hour seemed but a dream from which he had awakened, glad that it had been a dream.</p>

      <p>*So we've been teasing each other again,' began the old lady, smoothing over the unpleasantness of the remark by the familiar *we.' 'You must get married, children, before you fall out. Trust the words of an old woman! Don't imagine that you are testing your hearts. The longer you are engaged, the worse it will be.'</p>

      <p>'Once we are married it will be too late,' answered Borg. 'And as our dispositions and views differ so widely . . .'</p>

      <p>'What views are you talking of? Your Q</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>views don*t di£Fer! The girVs bored when you are away and runs after the preacher. And as for her disposition, it's one thing one day and another the next, it all depends on her nerves. A clever man like you. Axel, ought to know what women are ! *</p>

      <p>In his rapture at finding a woman who knew her sex, he would have liked to kiss the old lady's hand. But he remembered in time that he had heard this kind of talk whenever a woman wanted to get round him; that it was flattery rather than an admission, for directly matters had become serious, the remark had been withdrawn with interest. He controlled his impulse and answered quietly :</p>

      <p>*Well, we must wait, mother, we must wait; we can't get married out here, but in the autumn, when we are back in town . . . that is to say if Marie will display a little more sympathy with my work and a little less repugnance to my ideas on life and the world.'</p>

      <p>'You're so clever, Axel, it isn't strange that the poor child can't always follow you.'</p>

      <p>*If she can't rise with me, I certainly can't sink with her! But that is what she seems to want, and want it so determinedly that this morning I thought I could detect a secret hatred underneath it all.'</p>

      <p>'Hatred ! It's nothing but love, my boy!</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>Come and be kind to her and she'll be all right.'</p>

      <p>*Not after what's been said to-day. Either the words meant something and then we are foes, or they meant nothing and then one of us, at least, is not responsible.'</p>

      <p>*Well, she's not responsible! But you know, Axel, a woman is a child until she becomes a mother. Come along, old boy, and play with the child, or she'll choose other toys which might be more harmful.'</p>

      <p>*But my dearest mother, I can't play all day long without growing tired. And I don't believe Marie would like to be treated as if she were a child.'</p>

      <p>*0h, yes, she will, as long as you don't let her think you do! Oh ! Axel, Axel, what a baby you are in those things!'</p>

      <p>Another compliment which from anybody but his mother-in-law would have been an insult. When she seized his hand to take him along with her, he felt that he was giving way. By leaving his argument unanswered, she had put the question outside discussion; she had breathed on the tangles instead of unravelling them; she had coaxed his doubts to rest, she had caressed his uneasiness until it had fallen asleep. Her feminine atmosphere, her motherliness had beguiled him into giving up his will to personal freedom.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC ^^^</p>

      <p>He changed his coat and obediently, almost gladly, followed the garrulous old lady downstairs, to resume his chains and continue the game.</p>

      <p>In the hall he met the preacher who handed him a letter with the seal of the College of Agriculture.</p>

      <p>He immediately broke the seal. Then he put the letter into his pocket glad to have found a subject of conversation, a lightning conductor, and ran after Marie's mother, eager to tell her the news.</p>

      <p>*We are going to have a visitor,' he said. *The College is sending me a young man who'^ is to learn the art of fishing.'</p>

      <p>'I'm glad for your sake, Axel, you want male companionship,' commented the old lady, sincerely pleased.</p>

      <p>Borg went to his waiting fiancee with light foot-steps, knowing that armed with such news he would be able to navigate round the most unpleasant explanation.</p>
    </section>

    <section epub:type="chapter" id="c14">
      <h1 id="c14h01">CHAPTER XIV</h1>

      <p>A FEW days later Axel Borg went for a sail by himself, secretly, to lay salmon lines; he was late for dinner and as he walked up from the harbour, he heard laughter and gay voices which seemed to come from the porch of the ladies' cottage.</p>

      <p>When he reached the western gable-end, he saw through the two windows of the large room, which were built in the angle of the comer of the house, that the ladies were dining in the open and entertaining a male guest. Another step, and his eyes fell on Marie, on the point of raising a glass and handing it, with flashing eyes, across the table to the visitor, of whom he could see nothing but a pair of broad shoulders.</p>

      <p>He immediately remembered that once before he had seen the same gesture and expression in the eyes of the girl. He recollected their first meeting on the skerry, as she was offering the boatman a glass of beer. Then he had said to himself: *She is flirting with</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>the lout!' He wondered why he had never seen this expression in her eyes when she looked at him. Were her glances but a reflection of his own? Or did she hide her secret thoughts from him, her chosen victim ? He scrutinised her features. The longer he looked at her, the stranger her face appeared to him, so strange, indeed, that he could not suppress a feeling of uneasiness; the feeling which wrings a heart on discovering itself cheated by its best beloved.</p>

      <p>*If the eyes of an unseen observer can find out so much,' he mused, 'how much more will not the ears discover?' And he remained in his place and continued watching her.</p>

      <p>The mother rose and went into the kitchen leaving the young couple alone.</p>

      <p>They immediately dropped their voices, and Marie's eyes filled with tears as she listened to the stranger's eager words :</p>

      <p>'Jealousy is the basest of all vices: in love there is no right of possession . . .'</p>

      <p>'Thank you for these words! A thousand thanks!' replied the girl, raising her glass, her eye-lashes glistening with a few little tear drops. 'You are a man in spite of your youth ! You believe in woman !'</p>

      <p>'I believe that woman is the most splendid, the best, the loftiest of nature's achievements,*</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>continued the young man with growing enthusiasm. *I believe in woman because I believe in God!*</p>

      <p>'You believe in God?' interrupted Marie. *That proves your intelligence, for only stupidity denies the Creator.'</p>

      <p>Borg had heard enough. To test the high degree of hypocrisy to which his life's companion had attained, he appeared suddenly upon the scene, apparently quite composed and radiant with happiness at meeting her again.</p>

      <p>The girl retained her ecstatic expression; with the enthusiasm kindled in her by the stranger's proclamation of his faith in woman, she submitted to her fiance's embrace and returned it with a kiss more passionate than usual.</p>

      <p>Then she laughingly introduced Mr Blom, the expected assistant, who had arrived early in the morning and had already captured all hearts on the skerry, as he was a fisherman second to none in the whole world.</p>

      <p>•We were just talking of the herring on the West Coast, when you arrived and interrupted us,' said Marie in conclusion of the ceremony.</p>

      <p>Borg took no notice of the lie and allowed the dangerous 'interrupted' and the aggressive 'all hearts' to pass in silence, while he shook hands with the young giant of about twenty</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>years. The young man who was anything but an adept in the art of dissimulation seized the proffered hand with the air of a criminal and murmured a few unintelligible words.</p>

      <p>At this juncture the old lady re-appeared, shook hands with her son-in-law and began to clear the table.</p>

      <p>Conversation soon became lively. Marie made fun of her fiance's clothes, probably in the hope of being supported by the stranger.</p>

      <p>*Your veil, you know, is delicious,', she laughed. *You ought to carry a sunshade when you are sitting at the helm.'</p>

      <p>'All in good time, all in good time,' replied Borg, concealing his displeasure at being made fun of before a subordinate and a stranger.</p>

      <p>The assistant had evidently already formed a poor opinion of his all-too-considerate chief, but he could not suppress a feeling of discomfort as he watched the cruel treatment which the latter received from his fianc6e. A tactless compassion welled up in his heart, as his long fingers touched the veil which Axel Borg had wound round his hat.</p>

      <p>'But it's very practical, no doubt!' he said. And immediately resuming the caressing tone which he had used from the start, he added :</p>

      <p>*And if Miss Marie were as careful of her exquisite complexion . . .'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>* As you are of your beautiful hands !' The words had slipped from the girPs tongue as she touched the man's hand which was resting on the table, kneading bread-bullets.</p>

      <p>She had regained the mood which had possessed her during the whole morning.</p>

      <p>Borg felt at a disadvantage, like a man who eats his dinner in the presence of people who have finished, and it necessitated the exertion of his whole will-power to overcome the depressing effect which the conversation had on him. 'They're already admiring each other's physical charms in my presence,' he thought, disgusted. But he realised that if he gave the slightest sign of annoyance at this want of good breeding, his game would be lost; his criticism would at once be stamped with the name of that base vice which they had mentioned a short time ago.</p>

      <p>'You really have an unusually fine hand, a hand which speaks of intelligence,' he said, examining with the air of a connoisseur the object of his fiancee's admiration.</p>

      <p>She had not in the least desired his acquiescence; she made a side-leap, and tried to deal his apparent stupidity another blow.</p>

      <p>'How can you talk of intelligent hands!' she exclaimed with a silly little laugh.</p>

      <p>*I said hands which speak of intelligence.'</p>

      <p>1</p>

      <p>250 BY THE OPEN SEA</p>

      <p>*0h! you philosopher!' sco£Fed the girl. 'While you were dreaming we have eaten all the radishes/</p>

      <p>*I am glad to think that Mr Blom has had a good dinner, and it gives me great pleasure to see that you have anticipated me taking charge of his welfare,' replied Borg, unceremoniously. 'Allow me to welcome you, Mr Blom; I hope that you will enjoy your stay here in the wilderness. I'll leave you in Miss Marie's care. She will give you all the preliminary information on fishing, while I go upstairs and take a rest.' He turned to the girl. 'Grood-bye, sweetheart,' he said, 'take the young man in hand and guide him on to the right path. Good-bye, little mother!' he seized the hand of the lady and kissed it.</p>

      <p>His exit was unexpected, but the legitimate excuse advanced by him admitted of no contradiction, and did not leave a trace of unpleasantness behind. In addition it gave him the much begrudged advantage of the last word.</p>

      <p>Upstairs, in his room, he had hardly had time for a feeling of surprise at the incredible skill in the art of dissimulation, the ease in suppressing unpleasant sensations and hardening his heart with which 'the fear of losing her' had endowed him, when he found himself stretched out on the sofa with the rug drawn</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>over his head, on the point of sinking into a dreamless sleep.</p>

      <p>When he awoke a few hours later, he rose with the firm resolve of breaking o£F his engagement with Marie.</p>

      <p>The strongest tie which bound them together was habit, and habit, therefore, must work his release. But the void which his desertion would leave in her soul, must first be filled by another. And it should be he who seemed to have inflamed her senses from the first minute of their meeting.</p>

      <p>tie got no further. A knock at the door interrupted his thoughts.</p>

      <p>It was the preacher. He entered with many apologies, embarrassed, and hardly knowing how to pro£Fer his request.</p>

      <p>*Have you noticed, sir,' he began, 'that the natives are not over-scrupulous?'</p>

      <p>•I've known that for a long time,' answered Borg. 'What's up now?'</p>

      <p>'The workmen complain that timber has been stolen from the chapel and that they haven't enough to go on with.'</p>

      <p>'I'm not surprised. But what can I do ?'</p>

      <p>'You supplied what was necessary, sir.'</p>

      <p>'Oh I that's it! But I regretted it directly I saw that your sermons enticed the people away from their work and, indirectly, made thieves of them.'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>*You can't bring a direct charge . . .'</p>

      <p>'No! That's why I bring an indirect one. But if you want money, you must go elsewhere. Tell me one thing though. Who is this new assistant?'</p>

      <p>'They say he's been a naval cadet; his father is very wealthy, they say, and he's here to learn fishing.'</p>

      <p>At the opening of the conversation Borg had sat down near the window; he was watching Marie and the assistant playing at ball. He noticed that every time she threw back her shoulders to catch the ball, her skirt kicked up in front. The next time it happened he saw the assistant bending down with a laugh and making signs to her plainly conveying that he could see more than she thought.</p>

      <p>'Don't you think,' recommenced Borg, 'that a shop would be of great advantage to the people? They would no longer have to row to town to make their purchases. And perhaps the shop-keeper could give them credit if he sold their fish ? What do you say, Mr Olsson?'</p>

      <p>The preacher stroked his long beard; desire and indecision swept across his countenance.</p>

      <p>From his window Borg saw the assistant climbing the look-out while Marie stood below, clapping her hands.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>*A shop couldn't be anji:hing but a boon, Mr Olsson.'</p>

      <p>*I don't think the community would permit it unless, indeed, a reliable shop-keeper could be found; I mean to say a man who . . ..'</p>

      <p>'We'll choose a spiritually minded man and devote part of the profits to the chapel funds; then we shall have the community as well as the Foundation on our side.' The preacher's face beamed. 'In this way we might succeed.' 'Think it over and try to find a suitable man who wouldn't cheat the people and would refuse to defraud the church. Think it over! And now, another thing. I've noticed a good deal of immorality among the people. Have you seen, Mr Olsson, or do you suspect what is going on down below, at Vestman's ?'</p>

      <p>'People say there's something wrong there, but who can tell? I don't see how anybody could interfere.'</p>

      <p>'Don't you? But I wonder whether it hadn't better be stopped before they give themselves away. That sort of thing ends badly out here.'</p>

      <p>The preacher did not appear to be inclined to take the matter up; either he did not think it worth while, or he did not want to quarrel with the people: Moreover, to judge by his</p>

      <p>unhealthy appearance, he seemed preoccupied with some private trouble. He made up his mind suddenly and came out with his request.</p>

      <p>*I wanted to ask you, sir, if you couldn't give me something; the damp out here has given me ague.'</p>

      <p>'Ague ? Let me see! *</p>

      <p>In obedience to a sudden inspiration and without forgetting for a moment that he was dealing with an enemy who had challenged him, Borg felt the pulse of the patient, examined the tongue and the white of his eyes; then he gave his opinion.</p>

      <p>'They feed you badly at Oeman's?'</p>

      <p>*Yes, the food's wretched,' answered the preacher.</p>

      <p>'You are suffering from starvation, and in future you shall have your dinner from my table. Are you an abstainer ?*</p>

      <p>'That's to say—I take beer . . .'</p>

      <p>'Here's a preparation of quinine, to begin mth; take it three times a day; when you've finished the bottle come and tell me.'</p>

      <p>He gave him a bottle of quinine wine and added, taking his hand :</p>

      <p>'You mustn't hate me, Mr Olsson; we have great mutual interests, although our methods differ. If I can be of service to you, let me know.'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>So simple a means, the semblance of a little kindness was sufl&amp;cient to blind the preacher to such an extent that he thought he had found a friend. Sincerely moved, he shook Borg*s hand and stammered :</p>

      <p>*Once upon a time you did me a wrong, but God has turned it to good. Thank you, sir, for all your kindness; and please, don't forget about the shop. *</p>

      <p>'You may be sure I won't forget it,' said Borg, dismissing him.</p>

      <p>When Borg came downstairs to look for the assistant, he found him giving Marie a lesson in fencing, and evidently taking great trouble in trying to get sufficient elasticity into the girl's wrist and upper arm to ensure a pretty posture of defence.</p>

      <p>Borg, after a few flattering remarks, apologised for disturbing them; but he wanted to talk to the assistant about his lodging.</p>

      <p>*The only available room on the whole skerry is the attic above the ladies' room,' he said, boldly, as if he had used every eflFort to find him a room.</p>

      <p>'That's impossible!' exclaimed Marie.</p>

      <p>'Why?' contradicted Borg. 'Why should it be impossible? There's no other room, unless Mr Blom takes mine. But then I should have to live in the ladies' cottage and that's obviously impossible.'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>Since there was no alternative, the matter was decided there and then, and the luggage carried upstairs.</p>

      <p>*But now let*s talk business,* continued Borg, as soon as the assistant had installed himself. *The stromming has come. In a week's time fishing will begin. Therefore you must be off, Blom, to-night, if possible, while the wind is blowing from this quarter and see what you can do with the drift nets.'</p>

      <p>*May I go too?' asked JMarie, imitating the pitiful wail of a little child.</p>

      <p>'Certainly, my love, why not?' said Borg, 'that is if Mr Blom's agreeable. But you must excuse me if I leave you alone now; I must write the reports. You must be out at sea by one o'clock. Take the coffee kettle with you.'</p>

      <p>'Oh! what fun! what fun!' laughed the delighted girl, who seemed to have grown ten years younger.</p>

      <p>'I'll go and see that the boats and nets are being got ready. Go to bed early, so that you won't oversleep yourself.'</p>

      <p>And he went, surprised at the extraordinary ease with which he carried his points, since he had given up an impossible defence and proceeded to the attack.</p>

      <p>For the first time he entered the cottage of the inimical Oemans.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>It did not escape him that he was greeted with coldness and dislike. But he asked such direct questions, gave such definite orders, that no one dared to oppose him. He said a few kind words about the children, prophesied better times for all the skerry, took all responsibility on his own shoulders, said a word or two about the shop, warned the people to have barrels and salt in readiness, and told them that if they had no money to buy them, they could have a loan.</p>

      <p>He left, the friend of everybody, and Oman extracted a promise of some strong cough drops.</p>

      <p>From Oeman*s cottage he went down to the sheds and selected a number of nets with stiflF floats and strong ropes. He carefully examined the best boat and engaged two powerful rowers.</p>

      <p>By the time all these preparations were completed, the supper bell went in the ladies' cottage.</p>

      <p>During supper he talked to the mother, while the yoimg people, as he called them, were absorbed in teasing and devouring each other with the eyes, as if they were unable to resist the mutual attraction of their bodies.</p>

      <p>'Are you going to leave those two alone together?* whispered the mother.</p>

      <p>R</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>'Why not? If I get angry, I shall make</p>

      <p>myself ridiculous, if I don*t . . / * You'll make yourself more ridiculous !' 'Very well, in any case then! It doesn't</p>

      <p>matter what I do! Good night, mother.'</p>
