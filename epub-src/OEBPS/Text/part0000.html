      <h1 id="c01h01">CHAPTER I</h1>

      <p>A FISHING boat was sailing on a May evening with a side-wind across an open stretch of the southern part of the Stockholm Archipelago. The Skerries, with their well-known three pyramids, turned blue in the distance and as the sun was setting, clouds began to gather in the clear evening sky. The waves dashed against the headlands, and an ominous flapping of the square sail showed that the land-wind was dropping before the newly awakened sea-breezes which seemed to blow from all directions.</p>

      <p>The Inspector of Customs of the East Skerries, a giant with a long black beard, sat at the helm, occasionally exchanging glances with his two subordinates who were sitting before him, one of them engaged in working the sheet which held the large square sail in the wind.</p>

      <p>Every now and then the helmsman glanced at the little man who was cowering close to the mast, nervous and shivering with cold, from time to time peevishly tucking his travelling-rug more tightly round his legs.</p>

      <p>It was evident that in the inspector's eyes he was nothing but a grotesque little object, something to sneer and laugh at, for he frequently turned to leeward and spat, in order to hide the laughter which he seemed unable to suppress.</p>

      <p>The little man was dressed in a beaver-coloured spring overcoat, a pair of moss-green trousers, very wide in the leg, laced boots made of crocodile leather and brown spats with rows of black buttons. His shirt front was completely hidden, but he wore round his throat a pale yellow silk muffler. His hands were well protected by salmon-coloured kid gloves with three buttons; round the right wrist he wore a heavy gold bangle, made in the shape of a snake biting its own tail; the fingers of the gloves plainly revealed the fact that he was wearing rings. His face, as far as one could see it, was haggard and deathly pale, a small, thin, black moustache, turning up at the ends, accentuated its pallor, and gave its expression something exotic. He had pushed his hat on the back of his head, so that his black hair was visible, cutting a straight fringe across his forehead and looking like a little skull-cap.</p>

      <p>But what seemed to fascinate the man at the helm more than anything else was the bangle, the moustache and the fringe.</p>

      <p>During the long cruise from Dalaro, the sea-side place, the helmsman, who looked upon himself as a wit, had attempted to enter into a facetious conversation with the Superintendent of Fisheries, whom he had orders to take to the station in the East-Skerries. But the young savant had received his quips and familiarities with so much insulting indifference, that the inspector became more and more convinced that the Superintendent was a snob.</p>

      <p>The breeze freshened after they had left Hansten, the furthest island, behind them, and started on the more dangerous part of the voyage. The Superintendent of Fisheries, who held a chart in his hand on which he had entered the replies to his occasional questions, now put it into his pocket and turned to the helmsman.</p>

      <p>'Please be a little more cautious in managing the sails,' he said in a voice which sounded more like a woman's than a man's.</p>

      <p>'Are you afraid, sir?' asked the helmsman with a sneer.</p>

      <p>'Yes, I don't want to risk my life,' answered the Superintendent of Fisheries, 'I value it too much.'</p>

      <p>'More than that of others?' remarked the helmsman, disapprovingly.</p>

      <p>'Well, yes, since it is my own. And there are risks attached to sailing, especially to sailing with the square sail.'</p>

      <p>'Think so ? You know all about the square sail, I take it?'</p>

      <p>'I know nothing at all about it! But I have eyes to see where the full force of the wind strikes. I am able to calculate the resistance offered by the weight of the boat, and I can easily tell when the sail is going to jib.'</p>

      <p>'Then you'd better take the helm yourself,' replied the helmsman, gruffly.</p>

      <p>'Oh! no. That's your business! I don't sit on the box when I travel on the King's business.'</p>

      <p>'You mean, of course, that you don't know how to sail a boat.'</p>

      <p>'Even if I didn't, I'm sure it's easy enough; every other schoolboy and every single customs officer can do it. I should have no need to be ashamed of my ignorance. But be careful, I tell you, I don't want to get wet and spoil my gloves.'</p>

      <p>There was nothing more to be said, and the inspector, who was the highest authority in the East Skerries, felt snubbed.</p>

      <p>After a turn of the wheel the sail filled again, and the boat steered a straight course to the island; the passenger could see the white-washed walls of the custom-house which shone blindingly in the light of the setting sun.</p>

      <p>One by one the islands in closer proximity to the coast disappeared, and it soon became evident that the boat had travelled beyond the shelter of the land. She had reached the open sea, stretching out before her in its boundless infinity, darkly threatening in the east. No more chance of cruising under the lee of islands and islets; no possibility, in the event of a storm, to reef the sails. Their way lay straight into the heart of the threatening peril, across the black chasm to the little islands which looked no bigger than buoys cast into the ocean.</p>

      <p>The Superintendent of Fisheries who evidently valued his life, and was sufficiently intelligent to be able to realise the insignificance of his power of resistance against the illimitable powers of almighty nature, felt uncomfortable. With his thirty-six years he was far too clear-sighted to over-estimate the discretion and courage of the helmsman, whose tanned face and black beard did not inspire him with confidence. He knew that no arm, be it never so muscular, could successfully strive against a gale which blew with pressure of several thousand pounds against an unstable sail; he recognised the kind of courage that is founded on lack of sound judgment. What folly, he thought, to risk one's life in a small, open boat, when there are such things as decked ships and steamers! What incredible foolishness to hoist so large a sail on a mast made of pinewood which bends like a bow in the grip of the gale! The lee-shroud hung limply, so did the bob-stay, and the ftdl pressure of the gale lay on the weather shroud which, he felt sure, was rotted almost through. He was no longer willing to trust to such a doubtful chance as the more or less questionable stoutness of a few hempen ropes; at the next gust of wind, therefore, he turned to the man at the halyard alid said curtly, in a commanding voice :</p>

      <p>'Lower that sail!'</p>

      <p>The man stared aft, awaiting the helmsman's orders, but the Superintendent of Fisheries repeated his command with such firmness that the sail dropped.</p>

      <p>'Who the devil's in command here?' shouted the inspector, furiously.</p>

      <p>'I!' replied the Superintendent of Fisheries.</p>

      <p>He turned to the two men with a fresh command:</p>

      <p>'Take your oars and row!'</p>

      <p>The men obeyed silently. They took their oars; the boat shipped water repeatedly, for the angry inspector had left the wheel. 'Steer the boat yourself, then' he growled.</p>

      <p>The superintendent sat down at the helm and seized the tiller before the inspector had finished swearing.</p>

      <p>The thumb of his kid-glove split at once, but the boat righted herself. The inspector, smiling in his beard, took an oar, prepared if necessary, to keep her on her course.</p>

      <p>The superintendent had no time to watch the sceptical sailor but stared strenuously to windward. Soon he could distinguish the swell with its long downward slope from the wind-tossed wave with its short waterfall. A quick glance aft, measuring the drift, and a mental note of the current in the wake left him no doubt as to the course he ought to steer to prevent the boat from being driven past the East Skerries.</p>

      <p>The inspector who had for some time tried in vain to attract the black, burning eyes, so that they should become aware of his smile, abandoned his purpose; it seemed as if those eyes would have nothing to do with him, as if they purposely avoided contact with something which might trouble or pollute them. His efforts frustrated, he became depressed and absent-minded. After a while he began to watch the manoeuvres.</p>

      <p>The sun was now touching the horizon and the waves broke, dark purple, almost black at the base, deep green at the hollow. Whenever the breakers rose to any height, they shone like huge emeralds, and the foam, hissing and splashing, glowed in the setting sun like champagne. The boat with her crew lay in the twilight; but, on the top of the wave, the four faces flashed up for a moment every now and then, and as quickly sank back into the gloom.</p>

      <p>But the seas did not always break, the billows rocked and dandled the boat, lifted her up and drove her slowly forward.</p>

      <p>It seemed as if the little helmsman could foretell the approach of a breaker. He met it with a light pressure of the tiller, stood off, or crept past the terrible green wall, which threatened to break over the boat and swamp her.</p>

      <p>The lowering of the canvas had really increased the peril; it had lessened the propelling force and they now lacked the Iffting power of the sail.</p>

      <p>The inspector, amazed at the incredible subtlety of the manoeuvring, was seized with admiration. He could tell from the constantly changing expression of the pale face and the movements of the black eyes that their owner was engaged upon calculations of the most difficult description. After he had rowed for a while in silence, so as not to appear altogether superfluous, he thought the time had come to express appreciation voluntarily, before he was made to do so against his will.</p>

      <p>'It isn't the first time he's sailing a boat,' he remarked casually.</p>

      <p>The superintendent who was fully occupied and, moreover, anxious to avoid coming into contact with the man, for fear of being taken in unawares by the apparent superiority of the giant, made no reply.</p>

      <p>His right glove had split all along the ball of the thumb, and the bangle had slipped over his wrist. When the light on the crests died away and twilight sank on the sea, he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, produced an eye-glass and fixed it in his right eye; then he turned his head in quick succession to the right and left, as if he were making a mental note of landmarks which did not exist. Finally he asked :</p>

      <p>'Are there no beacon fires on the East Skerries?'</p>

      <p>'.Unfortunately not,' answered the inspector.</p>

      <p>'Any shallows?'</p>

      <p>'A clear course.'</p>

      <p>'Can we see the lighthouses of Landsort and Sandhamm from here?'</p>

      <p>'Landsort yes, but hardly Sandhamm.'</p>

      <p>'Stay in your places, then; we shall make port all right' directed the Superintendent of Fisheries who had worked a reckoning from the three heads and some unknown points in the distance.</p>

      <p>The whole sky had clouded over, and instead of the May twilight semi-darkness enshrouded them. The boat rocked in what seemed to be a thin but impenetrable substance, lightless, in which the waves were but deeper shadows in the paler gloom which surrounded them, as they dived underneath the boat, lifting her up on their backs and emerging again on the other side, flattening down and mingling with the vast expanse. It became more and more difficult to distinguish friend from foe, and calculations were less and less to be relied upon. Two men were rowing on the leeside and one on the weatherside. The exercise of just the right amount of force at the right moment kept the boat afloat.</p>

      <p>The Superintendent, who could now distinguish nothing but the two beacon fires in the south, was compelled to trust to his ears instead of his eyes. But before he had become sufficiently expert to tell a wind-wave from a breaker by the roaring, moaning and hissing of the surge, the boat had shipped water. He put his feet on the bitt to save his: expensive laced boots from being spoiled.</p>

      <p>But before long he had mastered the harmonies of the sea. The march of the rushing waters told him when danger was approaching. The drum of his right ear perceived the increased pressiure of the wind which threatened to stir up the sea yet more profoundly. It seemed as if his acute senses had become nautical and meteorological instruments connected with the great battery of his brain behind the black fringe, covered by his ridiculous little hat.</p>

      <p>The men who, for a moment, had given vent to mutinous murmurs when the sea had broken over the boat, relapsed into silence when they noticed her swift progress, and unhesitatingly obeyed his word of command : port, or starboard!</p>

      <p>The superintendent had been making for the two beacon fires, and used his eyeglass to measure the distance. But the difficulty of steering a straight course lay in the fact that they could not see the lights from the houses on the skerries, because they were situated behind the shelter of the cliffs.</p>

      <p>An hour, or perhaps a little more, had gone by since they had embarked on their dangerous voyage, when a dark object appeared on the horizon. The man at the helm, resolved not to invite doubtful advice, which might clash with what seemed to him his far more reliable intuitions, steered towards the object, taking it for an island or one of its outlying reefs. He consoled himself with the thought that the making of any kind of port was better than this dreadful suspension between the sky and the sea. But the dark object approached with a velocity which far exceeded the speed of the boat. The superintendent began to wonder whether, after all, he had not made a mistake.</p>

      <p>In order to examine the nature of the object, and at the same time give a signal in case the dark wall should turn out to be a vessel neglecting to show her lights, he took out of his pocket a box of wind-matches, struck the whole bundle at the same time and, for a moment, raised the hand which held it high above his head; then he flung it from him in such a way that it lit up a few yards of the surrounding sea. The light penetrated the darkness but for a second, but the picture which it revealed, vivid and sudden as the picture in a magic lantern, remained before the eyes of the superintendent long after the darkness had once more closed around them. He had seen drift-ice heeling to a shallow, with the sea breaking over it like a vaulted grotto over a gigantic druse of lime-spar. A screaming flock of grebes and seagulls arose and was shrouded again in darkness. The sight of the heavy seas had impressed the superintendent like the sight of a coffin, waiting to receive the body of a man condemned to death. He realised in a flash the double danger of freezing to death and drowning. But the fear which paralysed his muscles, roused all the strength which lay dormant in his soul. In a fraction of a second he appreciated the full extent of their danger, conceived their only chance of escape and shouted : 'Stop !'</p>

      <p>The men who were sitting with their backs to the ice and had therefore remained ignorant of its existence, stopped rowing. The boat drifted towards the breakers which were from three to four yards high; for a moment a wave hung over the vessel like a cupola of green glass; then it broke and went down on the other side with its enormous volume of water, spitting, as it were, the boat into safety. She was half full of water, and the men were almost suffocated by the terrible pressure of air. Three screams, like the screams of three sleepers suffering from nightmare, rang out simultaneously; but no sound came from the fourth, the helmsman.</p>

      <p>He pointed in the direction of the island where they could now see a light a few cable-lengths to leeward; then he sank down in the stern and lay motionless.</p>

      <p>The boat ceased rocking; they had reached calm waters. The rowers sat on their benches like men intoxicated, mechanically dipping their oars into the water, an unnecessary proceeding, for the wind blew the small craft straight into the harbour.</p>

      <h1 id="c02h01">CHAPTER II</h1>

      <p>'What have you got in the boat, mates?' asked an old fisherman after a friendly good-morning which the wind carried away.</p>

      <p>'Supposed to be the Superintendent of Fisheries' whispered the inspector who was dragging the boat up the shore.</p>

      <p>'I see! One of those who come sniffing at the nets. He'll have a good time here, especially as he seems to be ill into the bargain,' replied Oeman, the fisherman, who seemed to be the head of the poor and humble population.</p>

      <p>The inspector waited for the superintendent to get up and go ashore. But when the little bundle in the stem remained motionless, he grew uneasy, and climbing back into the boat, took the lifeless body into his arms and carried it ashore.</p>

      <p>'Is he dead?' asked Oeman, not without a certain note of hope in his voice.</p>

      <p>'There isn't much life left in him,' answered the inspector, carrying his wet burden into the cottage.</p>

      <p>One instinctively thought of the giant and Tom Thumb, as the tall inspector with his burden entered the kitchen in his brother's cottage where his sister-in-law was busy at the fire. An expression of compassion for the weaker flitted across the face with the large beard and the low forehead, as he laid the small body down on the sofa.</p>

      <p>'Here we are, Mary,' he said, putting his arm round his sister-in-law's waist. 'This is the Superintendent of Fisheries; let's put some dry clothes on him and something warm into his inside, and then he can go to bed.'</p>

      <p>Stretched out motionless on the hard, wooden sofa, the Superintendent of Fisheries cut a pathetic as well as a ridiculous figure. The high, white linen collar clung round his throat like a dirty rag; all the fingers of his right hand had burst through his glove, and his starched wristband, soaked with sea-water, was glued to the glove by the wet starch; the small laced boots of crocodile leather had lost their shape and brightness; the inspector and his sister-in-law had the greatest difficulty in pulling them off his feet.</p>

      <p>When at last host and hostess had succeeded in relieving the castaway of the greater part of his wet clothing and covered him with blankets, they heated some milk and poured out a glass of brandy. After taking hold of his arms and shaking him, the inspector raised the small body with the closed eyes and wide-open mouth, and slowly poured the milk down his throat. But when the woman tried to follow suit with the brandy, the smell of it seemed to affect him like a virulent poison. He pushed the glass aside and opened his eyes wide awake now, as if he had aroused himself from an invigorating sleep; he asked , to be shown to his room.</p>

      <p>He was told that it was not yet ready, but would be so in an hour's time, and was invited to rest quietly on the sofa while he waited.</p>

      <p>And there the superintendent lay, trying to while away an intolerable hour by a close examination of the furniture and occupants of the uninteresting cottage. It was the official residence of the inspector of the little custom-station on the East Skerries. Everything was small; the place was merely intended for a roof over his head. The white-washed walls, innocent of wall-paper, were as abstract as the idea of the State; four white rectangles enclosed a space covered by one white rectangle; impersonal, cold as a room in a hotel which is not meant to be lived in but merely serves as a temporary shelter. To hang a paper on the wall for the benefit of his successor or the Crown, had never entered into the head of either the present officer or any of his predecessors.</p>

      <p>This dead white room was furnished with dark furniture of cheap manufacture and semi-modern in style. It contained a round dining-table made of pinewood, full of knots, stained brown and covered with the marks of plates and dishes; a number of high-backed chairs of the same wood and style, some of them balancing on three legs; a bed-sofa of the cheapest material at the lowest price, on the principle of ready-made clothes.</p>

      <p>Everything was unsuitable; nothing was calculated to fulfil its mission, that is to say, to promise ease and rest; consequently everything was ugly, in spite of the <i>papier-maché</i> ornaments which profusely adorned the various pieces.</p>

      <p>Whenever the inspector sat down on one of the cane-chairs, leaning his broad shoulders against its back, his movements were invariably followed by an irritating creaking, which drew down upon him an angry expostulation from his sister-in-law, and a peevish entreaty to be careful with other people's property. The inspector replied with a familiar caress and a look which left no room for doubt as to the nature of their relationship.</p>

      <p>This discovery deepened the gloom which the appearance of the room had cast over the Superintendent of Fisheries. Being a naturalist, his conception of things permitted and things not permitted was not the conventional one but, on the other hand, he had a strongly developed instinct for that which was expedient under certain circumstances. To see the laws of nature sinned against gave him a painful feeling of bewilderment. It was just as if he had discovered in his laboratory that an acid which since the creation of the world united only with one base, suddenly, in defiance of its nature, united with two.</p>

      <p>It confused his theory of the evolution of monogamy from general sexual intercourse. He seemed plunged back into primeval ages, amongst savage tribes of men who lived, like the corals, for instance, in a massed and homogeneous community, long before selection and variation had created individuals and a law of the origin of species.</p>

      <p>When his glance fell on a little girl, about two years old, with the eyes of a fish in a head that was too large, walking through the room on tip-toe, as if she were afraid of being seen, he felt certain that this dubious birth had caused strife, must have had a disintegrating, disturbing effect. It was not difficult to foresee that the moment would arrive when the living witness would have to bear the brunt of another's sin.</p>

      <p>While he was following this train of thought, the door opened and the master of the house came in.</p>

      <p>He was the inspector's brother and occupied the humble position of a custom-house official. He was the better looking man of the two, fair, with an open, kindly face which inspired trust and confidence.</p>

      <p>He merrily wished them good-evening, sat down at the table by the side of his brother, took the child on his knees and kissed her.</p>

      <p>*We have a visitor,' said the inspector, indicating the sofa on which the superintendent lay, Hhe Superintendent of Fisheries, who has come to live here.'</p>

      <p>'Oh! Is that him?' replied Vestman, rising to greet his guest.</p>

      <p>He walked up to the sofa with the child in his arms. As he was the host, for his brother was a bachelor and lived with him as a boarder, he thought it incumbent on him to welcome his guest.</p>

      <p>*We are simple folk out here,' he said, after a few words of welcome. 'But my old woman is quite a good cook; she was in service in good families before she married me, three years ago. But since our little girl's come, she has something else to think of. . . . Well, well, children are sure to come if people stand by each other—that is to say, not that I need standing by . . .'</p>

      <p>The strange turn which the conversation had taken puzzled the superintendent; he wondered whether the man knew, or merely dimly guessed, that something was wrong. He, himself, had seen how matters stood before he had been in the house for ten minutes; could it be possible that the person directly concerned had noticed nothing in two long years?</p>

      <p>He was filled with disgust and turning to the wall shut his eyes and tried to pass away the remaining half-hour in musings of a pleasanter character.</p>

      <p>But he had no power to make himself deaf and was compelled to listen, against his will, to a conversation which had been lively, but soon dragged as if every word were carefully measured with a yard measure before it was pronounced. Whenever a pause occurred it was filled by Vestman, who seemed to detest a silence; as if afraid of hearing something which he did not want to hear, and not feeling at ease unless he intoxicated himself with his own words.</p>

      <p>When at last the hour had passed and there was still no mention of his room, the superintendent rose and asked whether it was not yet ready ?</p>

      <p>'Oh ! yes,' replied the hostess, 'it's quite ready, in a way, that is, but . . .'</p>

      <p>The superintendent ordered her peremptorily to take him to his room at once, reminding her that he had not come to pay her a visit but was travelling on the King's business. He pointed out that he was asking for nothing but what was his due; he had a right to the room by reason of the order which the Home Office had sent through the General Custom-House Authorities to the Royal Customs at Dalaro.</p>

      <p>This settled the matter. Vestman, carrying a candle in his hand, accompanied him upstairs to an attic, the furnishing of which left him at a loss to understand for what purpose the hour's delay had been required.</p>

      <p>It was an enormous room with whitewashed walls, like the room below. The large window in the middle of the long wall looked like a black hole, through which darkness streamed in, unrestrained by anything in the shape of window curtains.</p>

      <p>His bed, which was made, was of the simplest, and looked as if it had been merely raised a few inches above the floor to prevent the sleeper from lying in a draught. A table, two chairs and a wash-stand completed the whole furniture. The Superintendent of Fisheries, whose eyes were accustomed to receive a throng of impressions, was filled with dismay as he contemplated these bare necessities, which looked as if they had been scattered at random over the empty floor.</p>

      <p>The tallow candle struggled ineflfectuaUy against the darkness; the large window jseemed to devour every ray of light that emanated from the burning tallow.</p>

      <p>He felt lost; it was as if after the struggle of half a lifetime for refinement, a good social position and luxury, he had been thrust back into poverty, among a lower class of men; as if his soul, which loved beauty and wisdom, had been shut up in a gloomy prison, bereft of all its sustenance.</p>

      <p>These bare walls were the equivalent of the mediaeval monk's cell, where the absence of all pictures, the blankness of the environment, lashed the starving imagination to feed on itself; to create bright or sinister visions, merely to people the void. The blank, shapeless, colourless nothing of the white-washed walls begot in him a desire for pictures which the cave or hut of the savage had no power to evoke, of which the forest with its ever-changing colours and contours knew nothing; a desire which neither the plain, nor the heath with its ever-varying atmosphere, nor the restless, infinite sea had ever awakened.</p>

      <p>He was overwhelmed by an irresistible longing to conceal the walls behind sunny landscapes, gay with palm trees and parrots; to draw a Persian rug across the ceiling; to hide the plain deal floor, ruled like the pages of a ledger, under the skins of wild beasts; to fill the comers with luxurious sofas, hang a lamp over a round table covered with books and magazines; to place a piano against one of the short walls and cover the long wall with book shelves.</p>

      <p>And on one of the sofas should sit a dainty little woman; he did not care much who—</p>

      <p>Thus, while the candle on the table struggled with the darkness, his imagination glowed and sparkled and restlessly furnished and beautified his room.</p>

      <p>But ultimately it flagged; the bright visions disappeared and his hideous surroundings drove him to bed. He blew out the candle and drew the blanket over his face.</p>

      <p>The wind shook the gable, the water bottle clinked against the glass, the draught blew through the room from the window to the door, and played with his hair which the sea-breeze had dried; it gave him a feeling as if a hand were gently stroking his head. Between the gusts of wind the great breakers beat against the hollow cliffs of the southern part of the island with a sound like the roll of kettle drums in an orchestra.</p>

      <p>When he had grown accustomed to the monotony of wind and wave, he heard, at the moment of falling asleep, a man's voice underneath his room teaching a little child to say its evening prayer.</p>

      <h1 id="c03h01">CHAPTER III</h1>

      <p>On the following morning, when the Superintendent of Fisheries awoke from a deep sleep, —the result of his exertions on the previous day and the effect of the sea air,—and looked up from his pillows, he became aware of an incomprehensible stillness and noticed that his ear caught low sounds which he had never before been able to hear. He heard every little movement of the sheet as it rose and fell with his breathing; he heard the strands of his hair rubbing against the pillow-slip; the throbbing of his pulse in the jugular vein; the infinitesimal swaying of the bed which accompanied his heart-beat. He heard the silence. The wind had dropped completely; only the hammering of the surf on the compressed air in the caves on the sea-shore was audible, rh3rthmically every thirty seconds.</p>

      <p>From his bed, which stood opposite the window, he could see through the lower sash something like a blue window-blind, a little bluer than the air itself; it moved slowly towards him as if it were coming through the window to swamp the room. He knew that it was the sea, but it looked very small and stood up perpendicularly, like a wall, instead of stretching out like a horizontal plain, for the long rollers, fully illuminated by the sun, cast no shadows which could help the eye to form a perspective view.</p>

      <p>He jumped out of bed, put on some clothes and looked out of the window. The chill, damp air of his bed-room streamed out, and an enervating hot-house air, warmed for hours by the radiant May sun, poured in.</p>

      <p>He looked down on the rugged cliffs in whose crannies small, dusty heaps of snow still lingered and little white anemones blossomed, well-sheltered in their beds of moss. Poor, little wild pansies, pale yellow as if starving and blue with frost, hoisted in the warm spring air the poor colours of their poor country. Lower down heather and crowberry grew, peeping over the precipitous rocks, at the base of which lay a layer of white sand, pulverized by the sea, and flaunting here and there the scattered blades of the sand-oats.</p>

      <p>Beyond the cliffs a belt of sea-weed had been deposited which looked like a dark sash or a frame, framing the white sand. At the very top, almost jet-black, lay stacks of last year's accumulations, studded with shells, pine needles, loose sticks and fish-bones; closer to the sea, curly and grainy, brown as soap, the last gleanings, the fringe of the border.</p>

      <p>Washed up on the sandy beach was the crown of a pine tree, stripped of its bark, scrubbed by the sand, washed by the water, polished by the wind, bleached by the sun; it looked like the chest of a skeleton mammoth. A whole osteological museum of similar skeletons and fragments was scattered up and down the shore. Here lay a beacon which for many years had indicated the fairway, looking, with its thick lower end, like the thigh bone of a giraffe with its joint. Close to it was a whole juniper bush, strangely resembling the skeleton of a drowned cat, stretching out its white narrow root as if it were a tail.</p>

      <p>Reefs and cliffs rose out of the shallow water, one moment shining wet in the sunshine, and in the next swamped by the sweeping, turbulent waves. But when the impetus was not strong enough to carry the heaving masses across the obstacles which blocked their way, they broke with a crash, throwing a waterfall of foam high up into the air.</p>

      <p>Beyond them lay the open sea, the great 'flat,'' as the fisherman calls it. Now, in the early morning hour, it stretched out before Borg's eyes like a piece of blue cloth, without folds or creases, but swelling like a flag in the wind. The huge, round flat would have tired the eye, had it not been for a red buoy, anchored not far from one of the rocks, which looked like a red seal on an enormous letter, illuminating and lighting up the monotonous surface.</p>

      <p>It was unmistakably the sea, nothing new to the Superintendent of Fisheries, who had seen many comers of the earth, but it was the solitary sea, the sea under four eyes. It was not terrifying like the wood with its dark recesses, it had the calming effect of a large, blue, candid gaze. Everything could be seen at a glance; there were no hiding-places, no ambushes. It flattered the beholder to be always, wherever he might find himself, the centre of the surrounding circle. The huge stretch of water was like a materialised emanation of the observer, existing only in and through him who, now that he stood on firm ground, felt intimate with this no longer dan-gerous force of nature, superior to its gigantic powers, because it could no longer reach him. When he thought of the peril he had escaped on the previous evening, of the terror, and wrath which had obsessed him in the struggle with the brutal enemy he had outwitted, he smiled magnanimously at the vanquished foe, blind tool of the gale, now lying before him stretched out luxuriously, resting in the sunshine.</p>

      <p>He was on the East Skerry, classical because of its old history, because it had lived, flourished and decayed; the old East Skerry, which had been a good-sized fishing village in the Middle-Ages, where that important article, the strömming, was caught. Special guild regulations had been drawn up in those times for the fishing village and have been preserved to this day.</p>

      <p>The strömming has been to the North of Sweden and Norrland what the herring has been to the West Coast of Sweden and Norway; it is, indeed, nothing more or less than a herring adapted to the smaller conditions of the Baltic.</p>

      <p>Very much sought after at times when the herring is rare and expensive, less coveted when it is plentiful, it has long been the staple winter food of Central Sweden. There is an old song in which the Frenchmen, whom Queen Christine had induced to immigrate, complain of the eternal black bread and the everlasting strömming. A generation ago the big land-owners still paid their servants' wages in herrings; when the herring fishing declined, they paid in strömmings. The price went up and the fishery which until now had been of no great importance and merely covered the daily needs, assumed the more lively character of a speculation. The shallows which frequently occur round the East Skerries and are the richest in the Stockholm Archipelago, were worked on a large scale. The fish were disturbed during the spawning season; the meshes of the nets became smaller and smaller. The natural consequence was that the catches decreased; not so much, perhaps, because the fish were becoming extinct, but rather because they shifted their spawning grounds and retired to greater depths. No fisherman had ever thought of seeking their retreating prey in those profounder deeps.</p>

      <p>Scientists had long endeavoured to find a reason for the declining strömming industry, when the Agricultural College decided to appoint experienced superintendents of fisheries, whose task it should be to discover the cause of the evil and find a remedy.</p>

      <p>This was to be Borg's main task on the island during the coming summer.</p>

      <p>The skerry was one of the less frequented ones; it was not situated on any of the more important approaches to Stockholm. The large ships coming from the South, as a rule sail past Landsort, Dalaro and Vaxholm; from the East, and at certain seasons from the South as well, their way lies past Sandhamm and Vaxholm, while the merchantmen from Norrland and Finland generally sail through the Sound of Furu and Vaxholm.</p>

      <p>The waterway past the East Skerries is an emergency way. It is mostly frequented by the Esthonians who, as a rule, come from the south-east; others use them when windj tide, or foul weather has driven them to the north of Landsort or below Sandhamm. For this reason the island possesses only a third-class custom-house, managed by an inspector, and a small pilot station which is run from the main station at Dalaro.</p>

      <p>Here is the end of the world! It is quiet, desolate and silent, except during the fishing seasons in the autumn and the spring. If, as it happens sometimes in the height of the summer, a yacht calls at these forsaken shores, it is welcomed as a revelation from a brighter and happier world.</p>

      <p>But the Superintendent of Fisheries, who had come on very different business, 'to sniff about,' as the people called it, was greeted with unmistakable coldness. This coldness had first expressed itself in the indifference with which he had been received on the previous evening; the bad and cold coffee which was brought up to his room on the following morning, was but another expression of it.</p>

      <p>Axel Borg was endowed with a very fastidious sense of taste, but through self-discipline he had acquired the capacity of mastering unpleasant sensations. Therefore he swallowed his coffee without blinking, and then went out to examine the island and make the acquaintance of its inhabitants.</p>

      <p>As he passed the inspector's kitchen, the murmur of voices ceased; it was as if the occupants wished to make themselves invisible; they closed the door and broke off their conversation so as not to betray themselves.</p>

      <p>With the disagreeable feeling of being an unwelcome guest, he continued his walk across the skerry and soon reached the harbour. On his way he passed a row of small cottages built in the simplest style; mere piles of stones, here and there held together by a little cement. The chimney alone was built of bricks and erected above the kitchen fire. A wooden shed was attached to the corner of one of them; another had a lean-to, principally composed of poles and loose sticks, a shelter for the pigs which were brought here during the fishing season to be fattened. The windows looked as if they had been taken from wrecks; the roofs were covered with anything of any size which could absorb rain or allow it to run off: sea-weed, sand-oats, moss, turf, mould.</p>

      <p>Such were the shelters which, though at present forsaken, accommodated about twenty sleepers each, during the height of the fishing season; in those days every cottage was a little inn in itself.</p>

      <p>Before the most important of these hovels stood the chief man of the skerry, Oeman, a fisherman, cleaning his flounder net with a switch. Although he could in no way be considered one of Borg*s subordinates, he felt oppressed and irritated by the superintendent's presence, and was prepared to answer him sharply, should he ask any questions.</p>

      <p>'A good catch?' asked Borg, by way of greeting.</p>

      <p>'Not so far, but it'll be all right now that Government's looking us up,' answered Oe-man, rather uncivilly.</p>

      <p>'Whereabouts are the shallows which the strömming frequents?' continued Borg, leaving the Government to its fate.</p>

      <p>'The Superintendent ought to know that better than we do,' replied Oeman, 'he's paid to tell us.'</p>

      <p>'Quite so ! You only know where the shallows are, but I know where the strömming can be found. There, you see, I have the advantage of you.'</p>

      <p>'Is that so?' sneered Oeman. 'We need only dip our nets into the sea and the fish are ours ? I never! Well, well, one is never too old to learn.'</p>

      <p>At this juncture his wife came out of the cottage and addressed some querulous questions to her husband. Borg saw no advantage in contiuing his conversation with the unfriendly fisherman and went down to the harbour.</p>

      <p>On his way he passed some pilots who were sitting on the landing-bridge; as soon as they saw him, they eagerly resumed a languishing conversation and seemed very much disinclined to take any notice of him.</p>

      <p>He was determined, however, not to retrace his foot-steps, and continued his way to the shore. The inhabited part of the island soon came to an end, and the naked skerry lay before him, desolate, without tree or shrub, for everything which fire could destroy had been burnt.</p>

      <p>He walked along the edge of the sea, now across the fine, soft sand, now over the stones. After he had walked for about an hour, always keeping to the right, he found himself back at the starting point. He felt like a prisoner; the elevation of the little island oppressed him, the circular horizon of the sea weighed him down. The old feeling of being cramped came over him and he climbed the rocks until he reached the highest point, which was, perhaps, fifty feet above the level of the sea.</p>

      <p>There he threw himself on his back and gazed up into the sky. And now, as his eyes could catch no reflection, either of land or sea, and saw nothing but the blue dome above him, he felt free, isolated like a cosmic disc, hovering in the ether, subject only to the law of gravitation. He felt himself utterly alone on the planet; it was as if the earth were a chariot rushing with him through space. The gentle whispers of the biieeze were but the draught caused by the rush of the planet through the ether, the roaring of the waves was the plashing of the water in its huge reservoir as it swung round its axis. Every memory of fellow-creatures, society, law and customs passed away, since he could see no single material particle of the earth to which he was bound.</p>

      <p>He allowed his thoughts to rove like untethered calves, ignoring every obstacle, every consideration. His fancies intoxicated him until he was almost hypnotised, as the navel-gazers of India forget heaven and earth in the contemplation of a trivial part of their physical bodies.</p>

      <p>But the Superintendent of Fisheries was no more a worshipper of nature than the Indian devotee is a navel worshipper; on the contrary, being conscious of his superiority, and knowing himself as the highest link in the terrestrial chain of creation, he felt a certain contempt for the lower forms of life. He was well aware that the products of a self-couscious spirit are frequently far more ingenious than those of insensible nature; above all that there are things of greater advantage to man who works with a definite striving towards use and beauty. But he went to nature for the raw material; although light and air can be produced artificially, he preferred the unrivalled waves of the ether emanating from the sun, and the inexhaustible source of oxygen contained in the atmosphere. He loved nature as a helper, a slave to his will. He rejoiced in his power to seduce this mighty foe and compel her to put her forces into his service.</p>

      <p>When he had lain there for an indefinite period, enjoying the deep peace of unbroken solitude, free from all outside pressure or influence, he rose and clambered down, ready to go home.</p>

      <p>On coming into the empty room which echoed to his foot-steps, he felt as if he were entering a prison-cell. The white squares and rectangles which formed the room in which he was henceforth to live, were the work of human hands, but they were the hands of inferior beings, concerned only with the simplest forms of organic nature. He was enclosed in a crystal, a hexahedron. The straight lines, the spaces of equal size, divided his thoughts into squares, ruled his soul with lines, brought it down from the freedom of organic life to dead forms; they cut down the superabundant vegetation of his brain with its ceaselessly changing impressions to the first childish attempts of nature to emerge from chaos.</p>

      <p>He called the maid, asked for his boxes and started at once on the transformation of his room.</p>

      <p>He began by covering the windows with a pair of heavy, flesh-coloured Persian curtains, which at once toned down the crude light to a softer brilliancy. A large, two-leafed table filled the empty space on the huge white floor. But the white table-top still offended the eye; he concealed it under a piece of American cloth of a warm, moss-green tint, which harmonised with the curtains and gave the room a restful appearance. He put up his book shelves against the plainest wall; this in itself was no improvement, for it merely divided it into columns, and the dark brown wood made the crude, white-washed walls appear all the cruder. But he was intent on sketching the whole before giving his mind to detail.</p>

      <p>A nail in the wall was a convenient peg on which to hang his bed-curtains. This produced a room within a room, and provided him with a tent to sleep in, separated from the study.</p>

      <p>Over the long, white boards with their parallel black chinks in which mud from the street, dust from clothes and furniture, tobacco ash, scrubbing-water and sweepings formed hot-beds for fimgi, and refuges for woodworms, he scattered small rugs of various colours and patterns, which swam on the great white 'flat' like flowering islets.</p>

      <p>Having introduced colour and warmth into his empty room, he devoted himself to the detail. First and foremost he must build up a hearth, an altar dedicated to work, the centre and pivot round which everything should turn, from which everything should emanate. He began by putting up his tall lamp on the writing table. It measured two feet in height and rose up from the green table cover like a light-house. Its china stand, painted with arabesques of flowers and animals, as unlike reality as possible, was gay with colour, and its ornamentation proclaimed the power of the human brain to modify the fixed monotonous forms of nature according to will and fancy. The painter had transformed a stiff thistle into a creeper; compelled a hare to lie flat on the groimd like a crocodile and, the gun grasped between the tiger-claws of its front legs, aim at a huntsman with a fox's head.</p>

      <p>Round the lamp he grouped his microscope, diopter, scales, deep-sea lead and bearing-compass; a warm, golden light was reflected from their lacquered brass.</p>

      <p>The inkstand, a huge dice made of cut glass, radiated the pale blue light of water or ice. The penholders, made of the quills of the porcupine, with their vague, rich tints, gave the illusion of animal life. The crude scarlet of the sealing-wax, the coloured labels of the boxes of nibs, the cold glimmer of the steel scissors, the lacquer and gilt of the ash tray, the bronze paper-knife,—all these trifles, pretty and useful, soon covered the table, an abundant number of halting places, where the eye could rest for a moment and receive an impression, a memory, an inspiration, so that it always remained occupied without ever growing tired.</p>

      <p>Next he proceeded to fill the gaps on his shelves and breathe life into the empty spaces between the dark boards. And soon there stood, row after row, a varied collection of books of reference and guides, from which their owner could extract information on all things; encyclopa-dias which, like a semaphore, answered to a pressure on the right letter; text books of history, philosophy, archaeolog}'', the natural sciences; books of travel through all the countries of the earth, with maps; even a complete edition of Baedeker's guides. He could sit in his armchair and plan the shortest and quickest route to any given spot on the globe, select a hotel and calculate exactly what amount he would have to spend in tips.</p>

      <p>But since all these works carried within themselves the inevitable germ of old age, he had manned a separate shelf with an army of observation, consisting of special journals, which reported progress to him, even in the most insignificant matters. And, finally, a whole collection of skeleton keys to the knowledge of the age, in the shape of bibliographical notices, publishers' catalogues and booksellers' lists.</p>

      <p>Thus, shut up in his room, he could tell exactly how high, or how low, the barometer stood in all the sciences which interested him.</p>

      <p>As he gazed at his book shelves it seemed to him that now, at last, the room was inhabited by living souls. The books were like individuals, no two of them were alike. There was Bcedeker in scarlet and gold, resembling a man who, on a fine Monday morning, gives care the slip and starts on a journey. Others, like the Encyclopcedia Britannica, a long procession, were dressed in black. The paperbacks wore light, gay summer dresses. The Revue des Deux Mondes was clothed in salmon-pink, the Contemporaine wore a lemon-coloured dress, the Fortnightly was in blue, the Morgenldndische in emerald. Great names greeted him from the backs, like friends who had come to stay with him; he had the very best of them there, far more than they could give to a visitor, who called on them casually, and disturbed their breakfast or afternoon nap.</p>

      <p>By the time he had completed the arrangement of his writing table and book shelves, he had recovered from the unpleasant effects of the journey; his soul had regained its strength as soon as he had re-possessed himself of his tools; those instruments and books which had grown on him like new senses, new organs, stronger and finer than those with which nature had endowed him.</p>

      <p>The temporary attack of fear, excited by solitude and association with enemies,—for he was not mistaken when he regarded the island population as inimical—gave way to the calm which his installation had produced. Now that he had pitched his head quarters, he sat down like a well-armed general, to sketch his plan of campaign.</p>

    <section epub:type="chapter" id="c04">
      <h1 id="c04h01">CHAPTER IV</h1>

      <p>The wind had shifted during the night to north-east, and drift ice had floated down from the Gland Islands, when the Superintendent of Fisheries climbed into his boat to make a precursory examination of the bottom of the sea, the depth of the waters and the maritime fauna and flora.</p>

      <p>The pilot who was acting as boatman soon grew tired of giving explanations when he saw that the superintendent, with the help of chart, lead and various other instruments, found out things which had never once occurred to him. He knew where the shallows were situated and where the nets should be cast. But this did not satisfy the superintendent who dredged the bottom here and there and brought up animals and mucilage on which, in his opinion, the strömming fed; he plumbed the depths and collected samples of loam, sand, mud, earth and gravel which he sorted, classified and carefully put away in glass bottles with labels.</p>

      <p>Finally he unpacked a large telescope which looked like a speaking tube, and gazed into the sea. The pilot had never dreamt of the possibility of looking down into the water; struck with amazement, he asked to be allowed to put his eye to the instrument and examine the hidden profundities.</p>

      <p>The superintendent had no desire to play the part of the magician; on the other hand he was disinclined to make premature disclosures on the nature of the problem he had come to study, and by so doing go too far in raising in the people false hopes of a successful issue; he therefore confined himself to granting the pilot's request and furnishing some popular explanations of the living pictures which unfolded themselves before the man's astounded eyes.</p>

      <p>'Do you notice the bladder-kelp on the surface of the shallow?' he began his lecture, 'do you see that it is of a creamy yellow at the top, changes to a dull brown lower down and becomes red at the bottom? This effect is produced by the decreasing light.'</p>

      <p>He rowed a few yards away from the shallow, being careful to keep under the lee of the skerry, so as to avoid the drift ice.</p>

      <p>'What do you see now ?' he asked presently, addressing the man who was lying flat on his stomach.</p>

      <p>'God bless me ! I do believe they're strömmings! And they're crowded together as close as cards in a pack!'</p>

      <p>'Now will you believe that the strömming is not to be found in the shallows alone? Do you realise that it can also be caught in deep water ? And will you believe me when I say that it should be left undisturbed in the shallows? It only goes there to spawn, because in the shallows the sun can get to its eggs more easily than in deep water.'</p>

      <p>The superintendent went on rowing until he came to a part where the water, in consequence of the loamy nature of the ground, had a bluish-green tint.</p>

      <p>'What do you see now?* he began again, resting on his oars.</p>

      <p>'Good Lord in Heaven ! I believe those are snakes at the bottom of the sea! I can see their tails sticking out of the mud. And there are the heads ! '</p>

      <p>'Those are eels, my boy,' explained the superintendent.</p>

      <p>The pilot looked unconvinced; he had never heard of eels in the sea, but Borg wished to reserve his trump cards and had no inclination to waste his energy on elaborate explanations of things only dimly realised. He therefore returned the oars to the pilot and resumed his seat at the telescope. He leant over the edge of the boat to observe with greater accuracy.</p>

      <p>He seemed to be looking for something with ardent zeal; something which he confidently expected to find in certain shallows, but which, of course, he had not yet found because he had not yet examined them.</p>

      <p>They rowed about for a couple of hours under his direction. Borg frequently let down his lead or his dredge. After every attempt he leant over the edge of the boat with his telescope. His haggard face shrank with the exertion, his eyes sank back into their sockets. The hand which held the telescope trembled, and his arm grew as stiff and insensible as a wooden stick. The chill, damp wind which penetrated the pilot's thick jersey, did not seem to affect the fragile figure clad in a half-unbuttoned, light spring overcoat. His eyes were watering with the wind and the strenuous efforts he made to discover some object in the almost impenetrable element which covers three quarters of the surface of the globe, and of which the fourth quarter knows so little and romances so much.</p>

      <p>With his telescope, which was not his own invention, but had been constructed from hints and directions given by builders of bridges and those engaged in sub-marine undertakings, he looked down into that submerged world from which the great terrestrial creation has evolved.</p>

      <p>The forest of sea-weed which has only just overstepped the boundary line between organic and inorganic life, swayed in the icy ground current, resembling the curdled white of an egg. It had borrowed its shape from the undulation of the waves and reminded one of the ice-flowers which the frost draws on the window panes in winter time. Its golden leaves rocked to and fro, far below the level of the sea. The inhabitants of those mysterious regions crept through the swaying branches on their bellies, seeking cold and darkness, a place in which to hide themselves and their shame at having been left behind in the long struggle towards sun and air.</p>

      <p>Deep down in the loam, half-buried in the slime, lay the flounder, immovable, an inert mass, unendowed with the inventive faculty of developing an air bladder which would lift it to the surface; waiting for a lucky chance which should carry the prey into its maw; without the instinct of hunting for it; turning and stretching in idleness until, for reasons of convenience, both eyes had been evolved on the right side of the mis-shapen head.</p>

      <p>The blenny, which has developed a pair of oars in front, but is too heavy in the stern and reminds one of first attempts at boat building, raised its architectural stone head, adorned with the moustachios of a Croat, above the heraldic foliage among which it had lain, and lifted itself for a short moment out of the mud only to sink back into it the next instant.</p>

      <p>The lump-fish with its seven backs stuck up its keel; the whole fish was nothing but an enormous nose, scenting out food and females; it illuminated for a second the bluish-green water with its rosy belly, surrounding itself with a faint aureole in the deep darkness; but before long its sucker again held safely to a stone, there to await the lapse of the million years which shall bring delivery to the laggards on the endless road of evolution.</p>

      <p>The hideous scorpene, fury incarnate, with the expression of frenzy in the uvulas of its face, with fins which have become claws, better adapted for torture than for attack and defence, lay voluptuously on its side, caressing its body with its slimy tail.</p>

      <p>Nearer to the surface, in the lighter and warmer water, swam the beautiful but melancholy sea-bass, perhaps the finest fish in the Baltic. Well built and plump, but still a little clumsy, like a ferry boat, nature has endowed it with the bluish-green colour, peculiar to the Baltic, and the general character of the North : philosopher and pirate rolled into one. A sociable hermit, a surface fish, fond of deep water and frequently to be found there; an eccentric idler who lies motionless in the water, staring at the rocks, until suddenly it wakes up to its surroundings and darts away like an arrow; a tyrant to its own kin, yet quickly pacified; fond of returning to its haunts and harbouring seven worms in its bowels.</p>

      <p>The eagle of the sea, the king of all the fish in the Baltic, the slender, sun-loving sea-pike, rigged like a cutter, sporting bright colouring since it need fear no rival, lifted up its nose above the surface and fell asleep with the sun in its eyes, dreaming, perhaps, of flowering meadows and inaccessible birch woods, of the transparent, blue ether which spans its damp world, in which it would suffocate, although the birds with their hairy fins swim through it with such consummate ease.</p>

      <p>The boat had run into the drift ice; the shadows of the great floes glided over the forest of sea-weed like clouds. Borg, who had for hours vainly tried to discover what he sought, now took his telescope out of the water, carefully dried it and put it aside.</p>

      <p>He sat down in the stern, covered his eyes with his hand and seemed to fall asleep. A few minutes elapsed before he made a sign to the pilot to go on rowing.</p>

      <p>During the whole morning the attention of the superintendent had been rivetted on the bottom of the sea; it was only now that he seemed to notice the exquisite beauty of the panorama which unfolded itself before his eyes.</p>

      <p>The colour of the water which lay stretched out before him was of the deepest blue as far as the spot where the drift ice began to reproduce a perfect arctic landscape. Islands, bays and fiords were marked as if on a huge map. In places where the ice was jammed against the reefs, mountains had been formed, block climbing on block, pressing down the preceding one. The floes lay piled up on the tops of rocky islets, forming vaults and grottoes, towers, ruined churches, citadels and bastions. The fascination of these formations lay in the fact that they looked as if they had been fashioned by a gigantic human hand; they were unlike the vague shapes which insensible nature produces, and awakened memories of human handiwork of long past historical epochs. In one part the ice floes were heaped up like walls built by Cyclops, and arranged in terraces like a Graeco-Assyrian temple. In another part the tireless waves had excavated a Romanesque barrel-vault and carved out an arch; in settling down the latter had been transformed into a Moorish horse-shoe which the rays of the sun and the spray had honeycombed and hacked into stalactites. Here the rollers had cut into an already finished wall a canal with the roof of a Roman aqueduct; there were the foundation walls of a mediaeval castle, showing traces of tumbled-down Gothic arches, gables and turrets.</p>

      <p>This see-sawing on associated ideas between arctic landscapes and historical architecture, induced in the observer a peculiarly dreamy and hovering mood from which he was ultimately roused by the noisy demonstrations of life, proceeding from the flocks of migratory birds which populated the ice islands and the clear blue water.</p>

      <p>Eider-geese were here in their hundreds waiting for open water in Norrland; the insignificant rust-brown females crowded round the beautiful snow-white males which rose every now and then for a short flight, showing their jet-black breasts. Divers were present in smaller flocks, easily distinguishable by their grey breasts, reptile necks and, when they alighted, their wonderful wings, marked like a chess-board; legions of restless grebes, black and white, swimming, diving, flying; the small fry of the guillemots and puffins; flying columns of sinister, coal-black coots stood out from among the more brilliant groups of gossanders and saw-bills with their tufted heads. But above the whole diving and fluttering amphibious army hovered the sea-gulls which have chosen the air as their habitat, and use the water only as a fishing and bathing ground.</p>

      <p>A solitary crow had made its way into this busy, hustling world and perched, half hidden, on the skerry. With its suspicious colouring, its low forehead and thiefish ways, its unmistakal)le criminal type, its dirty, unwashed appearance, it formed an object of hatred to the industrious community which knew it only too well as the spoiler of their ijests, the ravisher of their eggs.</p>

      <p>From this winged world, whose throats were able to set the atmosphere trembling over the heads of the silent world dow% below in the water, rang out a symphony of sound, ranging from the low, feeble attempt of the hissing reptiJe to give voice to its anger, to the music produced by man's harmonious organs of soxmd. The eider-goose hissed like an adder, as its mate bit its neck and tried to push it under water; the saw-bill croaked like a frog; the terns screamed; the sea-gulls cried like children; the eider-ducks wauled like cats in the pairing season. But clearly audible above all the din and clamour, on a higher and more beautiful note, arose the wonderful music of the grebes. It could not be called song; it was a false triad in sharps, sounding like a shepherd's flute as it rose, forming an imperfect chord with the three notes of the others, a canon for bugle calls without beginning or end; memories of the childhood of mankind, the first ages of hunters and shepherds.</p>

      <p>The watcher did not look upon the great spectacle with the dreamy eyes and the dark, and therefore troubling and vague emotions of the poet, but he saw with the calm eye of the scientist and thinker the connexion in this apparent chaos. The immense stores of knowledge laid up in his memory enabled him to discover the relationship which existed between these things. And as he speculated on the cause of the overwhelming impression which just this particular aspect of nature made on him, and found the answer to the riddle, he was filled with the inexpressible joy which the most highly developed being in the chain of creation is bound to feel when the veil which lies over the hidden mysteries is lifted for him; the happiness which has accompanied all creation on the infinite road to light and was, perhaps, the impelling power which led humanity from the world of dreams to the world of knowledge; a happiness rivalling the bliss which a potential creator might feel in realising his creation.</p>

      <p>The spectacle offered by this landscape transported his mind to primeval ages, when the whole earth was submerged and only the highest mountain tops showed above the water. The skerries still preserved the character of the primary formations with their primitive rocks climbing straight up to the light. But down below, in the water, where at the same time the algae of the cooling period had appeared, swam among the first fishes the ancestor of the herring, while on the skerries the ferns and club moss of the carboniferous period still flourished. Nearer to the continent, on the bigger islands, the conifers and reptiles of the secondary period could be found; and still further inland the trees and mammals of the tertiary. Out here, in these primary formations, capricious nature seemed to have skipped all periods of stratification. Seals and otters had made their appearance in the primary ages, and only this morning the glacial period had been flung into the quaternary like garden mould on a primitive rock. And there was he, himself, the representative of historical time, enjoying, undisturbed by the apparent chaos, those living pictures of the history of creation, his enjoyment heightened by the knowledge that he occupied the highest rung in the ladder.</p>

      <p>This was the mystery of the spell which the landscape wielded; it was the story of creation with omissions and abbreviations. It enabled the beholder to travel in a few hours through all the stages of evolution, while he remained where he was. He could indulge in the rejuvenating sensations which lead the mind back to first origins; rest at stations long left behind, relax the weaiying tension inseparable from the efFort to reach a still higher stage on the upward path; sink into a healing trance and feel at one with nature.</p>

      <p>rSuch moments compensated him for the loss of his religious ecstacies; the longing for heaven was but the desire for progress in a diflFerent form; the dream of immortality a dim anticipation of the indestructibility of matter.</p>

      <p>What a wealth of re-assurance lay in the thought that one's home was this same earth which had been represented to one's childhood as a vale of sorrow to be traversed on the way to the unknown ! What unspeakable comfort was contained in the knowledge that science had investigated what had been hitherto unknown; had penetrated what had been called * God's mysterious ways'; had fathomed all the manifestations which had been regarded as inscrutable, because no-one knew how to solve their riddles. Now the truth of the origin and destiny of man stood revealed. But instead of withdrawing from the arena, weary of the struggle, as one civilised nation after the other had done when it had come to the end of its thought capacity, the generation now living had resolved to accept the doctrine of man's descent from the beast world, and realise the dream of Heaven in a practical manner here below.</p>

      <p>Surely the present age was greater and better than any of the ages which had passed away. It had done more for the enlightenment of mankind than all the centuries which had slipped into eternity.</p>

      <h1 id="c05h01">CHAPTER V</h1>

      <p>After the superintendent had reverently bowed his head before the Unknown God, in communion with his thoughts on human origin and destiny, he revived, in memory, the story of his personal evolution, tracing it as far back as he could, so as to meet, as it were, his inmost self, and read in the past pages of his life the destiny which probably awaited him in the future.</p>

      <p>He thought of his father, the late major of the garrison artillery, one of those indefinite types which marked the beginning of the century; a character composed of many parts, like a conglomerate; the refuse of past epochs, collected at random after the great explosion at the end of last century, and cemented together. He believed in nothing, for he had seen with his own eyes that everything passes, that everything comes again; he had seen nations trying every form of government, greeting new systems with shouts of acclamation and abolishing them in a few years' time; he had seen abolished systems resumed and lauded as epoch-making discoveries. Finally he had clung to existing facts as the only comprehensible verities, indifferent to the question as to whether they had been called into existence by a governing will—which was improbable—or a group of accidents—which was fairly certain but unwise to affirm.</p>

      <p>A few years at the University had converted him to the pantheism of the Neo-Hegelians, a clever reverse of the philosophy which was at that time pushed to extremities : nothing was real except the individual and God was the essence of individuality in humanity. This vivid conception of the intimate union of man and nature, with man as the highest link in the chain of the world-process, attracted a group of distinguished men who secretly despised the ceaseless efforts of political enthusiasts, to place themselves outside the inexorable laws of nature and, with the help of philosophical systems and parliamentary resolutions, discover new cosmic laws. They went their way unnoticed, of no practical use to high or low. Above, mediocrities gathered, through natural selection, round a mediocre monarch; below, they found ignorance, credulity and blindness; in the middle-classes an exclusive interest in trade which prevented them, as they were not traders, from becoming their allies. Being capable, clever and honest men, they were promoted as opportunity arose; but as they belonged to no party, had no inclination to waste their time on private opposition, were not sufficiently numerous to form a party by themselves and, moreover, being strong individualities, objected to running after a bell-wether, they remained pretty much in the background, concealing their displeasure beneath grand-crosses and orders, smiling like augurs whenever they met at council-board or upper house, and letting things take their course.</p>

      <p>Borg's father was a member of the aristocracy, but his title was not a very old one. The family had been raised to the peerage for services rendered to the country in connexion with the development of the mining industry, and not for questionable deeds in times of war, more or less attributable to natural coincidents or mistakes made by the enemy. Together with the title they had won some extremely moderate privileges. They were allowed to wear aristocratic uniforms and occupy honorary posts in the administration of the country. Major Borg therefore belonged to that section of the aristocracy which had won its privileges by distinguished service.</p>

      <p>The consciousness of being the descendant of highly gifted ancestors acted like a spur on their living representative. Money legitimately gained by the labour and talents of his forbears enabled him to choose any profession he liked. He became a distinguished topographer and took part in the construction of the Göta Canal and the building of the first railways.</p>

      <p>His constant occupation with the kingdom as a whole, which, depicted on a map and spread out on his writing-table before him, he was in the habit of taking in at a glance from above, gradually developed in him a faculty for dealing with things on a large scale. Seated in his arm-chair, ruler in hand, he would open a new trade-route which transformed the physiognomy of a landscape, buried old towns and created new ones; altered the price of commodities and opened up new sources of revenue. The map must be remade, the old water-ways forgotten ; the straight black lines which stood for the new railways were the only lines which mattered. The heights should become as fertile as the valleys; the fight for the rivers should cease, the borders between kingdoms be wiped away.</p>

      <p>Persistent reflection on the fate of countries and nations begot in him a strong feeling of power. Without knowing it, he gradually gave way to that inseparable concomitant of power, the inclination to over-estimate his own value. He fell into the habit of taking a bird's-eye view of everything; the countries became maps and men and women leaden soldiers. When the topographer succeeded in razing to the ground a mountain, the denudation of which would have required thousands of years in the ordinary course, he felt something of the joy of the creator. When he ordered tunnels to be blasted, sand-hills to be transported and cast into the lakes, moors to be filled up, he cotdd not help a feeling that the re-modelling of the surface of the globe had been given into his hands, for was he not throwing the legitimate geological formations into chaotic disorder? And all this fostered • the rapid growth of his self-conceit.</p>

      <p>Another factor was his social position; he was an officer with a great many subordinates with whom he communicated only by word of command; upon whom he looked as the muscles which existed solely for the purpose of serving his cerebral volition.</p>

      <p>Endowed with the physical courage and determination of the soldier, the thoroughness of the scientist, the sober-mindedness of the thinker, the calm of the financially independent, the dignity and self-respect of the man of hondijr, he appeared as a type of the highest order, a type in which beauty and intellect had contracted a union, the result of which was a discreet and harmonious personality.</p>

      <p>The father was an example as well as a teacher to the son who had lost his mother at an early age. To spare his boy the bitter moments of disillusionment, and also because he disapproved in its entirety the actual method of education which, he held, with its fairy tales and ghost stories produced children instead of men, he ruthlessly pulled aside the curtain which hangs before the temple of life and initiated his son in the difficult art of . living. He made him see the intimate connexion between mankind and the rest of creation; told him that although man had reached the highest stage of evolution on his planet, he had by no means arrived at the goal; that he could, to a certain extent, limit the effect of the natural laws, but was still ruled by them.</p>

      <p>His creed was a sensible nature worship, if by nature all existing things are understood, and by worship the appreciation of the fact that men are dependent on the natural laws. In this way he rendered the boy immune to the megalomania of Christianity, destroyed in him the fear of the unknown, of God and death, and produced an intelligent man who watched over his actions and took their consequences on his own shoulders.</p>

      <p>He sought the regulator of all base desires of the human heart in that organ which through its more perfect development differentiates mankind from the beast-world : in the cerebrum. Judgment founded on universal knowledge should control the lower instincts and, if necessary, suppress them, so as to keep the type up to a high standard. Feeding and the desire to propagate the species were the lowest instincts; man shared them with the vegetable kingdom. Emotions, as the humble thought-rudiments of the animals are called, were located in blood vessels, the spine, and certain other of the lower organs, and for that reason a human being of the higher type should unquestionably subordinate them to the cerebrum. Those members of the human family who were unable to regulate their base desires, were inferior types.</p>

      <p>Therefore the old man warned him to beware of youthful enthusiasm which, he said, was as likely to lead to crime as to virtue. An exception, however, were the great passions which benefited mankind in general, because they were not emotions but powerful expressions of the will to good.</p>

      <p>Nothing accomplished by youth could be of any real value since, as a rule, its accomplishments lacked originality and represented mainly the thoughts and ideas of their predecessors, adopted by the next generation as its own and hawked about with much flourish of trumpets. Originality could only exist in a mature brain, just as propagation in the true sense, and the consequent education of the offspring, could only take place when the man had attained to manhood and was in a position to provide for the education of the child. A sure proof of the inability of the immature brain to form an opinion was the conceit so characteristic of women and young men. *The future belongs to the young' was a fallacy, because statistics showed a smaller number of deaths among mature men than among adolescents. The quite witless retort: 'Youth is a fault which the years will correct' did not affect the fact that youth, while it lasted, was a defect, a deficiency, and therefore a fault. This was admitted by saying that it would pass away in the course of time. That which did not exist could not pass away. All the attacks of the young on existing institutions were so many hysterical outbursts on the part of the weak, incapable of bearing pressure; attacks as senseless as the attack of a wasp which, by its indiscretion, courted certain death. An excellent proof of the lack of ability to draw a conclusion and form an opinion was furnished by the history of the well-known book Robinson Crusoe; that book was obviously written with the intention of belittling a simple life and solitude; but in spite of this fact it had, for a whole century, been regarded by the boys of all nations as a panegyric on life in the wilderness. And yet this life was represented in the book as a punishment for a young fool who had used the gifts of civilisation like a savage. This little characteristic disclosed at the same time the fact that in the light of ontology a youth was a very low form indeed; he clearly showed it by his predilection for Red Indians and others who had been left behind on the road of evolution. The same thing applied to the emotions; in the days to come they would be shed like the thyroid gland which served no purpose, but had not yet disappeared from the human body.</p>

      <p>As the boy could not oppose these bitter truths with any arguments founded on reason, he declared that his feelings, his most sacred feelings even, were outraged by these dry doctrines. His father replied by calling him a wasp which still thought with its ganglia. He warned him of the dangers of an exuberant imagination, or of drawing inferences without sufficient reasons or abundant data, not to be confused, however, with the swift, scientific intuition which could draw new conclusions from, apparently, few suppositions, few, because the connecting links had been forgotten. Then, as in a chemical amalgamation, two older conceptions were fused together and a new thought was born. The science of origins proved conclusively that the human embryo . passed through all the older stages, from the amoeba to the frog and thence to the human form. How cotdd any young man doubt, therefore, that the intellect of a human child must pass through the whole history of humanity, from the animal and savage upwards, while its body was growing, and that, consequently, a man stood on a far higher plane than a youth ?</p>

      <p>And above everything the father counselled his son never to allow the lowest instinct, the sexual instinct, to influence his judgment. He told him that under its dominion enlightened men still clung to the superstition that woman, who was but an intermediary form between man and child—embryology proved that at one stage of its evolution the male embryo bore all the characteristics of the female, while the opposite was never the case—had reached the same high standard of development as man and, according to some views, even a higher one.</p>

      <p>To caution the boy against the supreme power of the sexual instinct was equivalent to casting a slur on womankind. And very soon the boy began to draw <i>ganglia-conclusions</i>, as his father called it, the essence of which was that the major was a misogynist. This was not to be wondered at. Axel was always made to listen to stories of how the life of this one and that one had been ruined by a woman; how great gifts had been rendered sterile by the effort of procreation; how happiness and career had been sacrificed to a woman who betrayed her husband, to children who died in infancy. Propagation was the business of small minds; the greater ones survived in their works.</p>

      <p>Such was the early teaching which the boy received. He was an unusually delicate child, but he possessed a well-knit frame, was endowed with fine senses, a quick and sure power of conception, a sharp intellect and a nobility of soul which expressed itself in a charming affability and a lenient judgment of his fellow-creatures. He had learnt at an early period to live an orderly life and suppress all plant and animal instincts.</p>

      <p>After having acquired a great store of observations and knowledge, he began to elaborate and arrange it. It soon became evident that he possessed the creative faculty—the faculty, that is, to deduce from two given facts a third unknown one, to distil new thoughts from old, in a word, originality. He was a reformer in the making, able to see the connexion in what appeared to be chaos; to discover the invisible force behind phenomena and the secret and, frequently, complex causes which prompt human actions. Therefore his school-fellows regarded him with suspicion and the masters felt that he silently criticised what they represented to him as proven facts.</p>

      <p>Close observation aroused in him the suspicion that everjrthing was but a struggle for power ; the desire of one brain to control others; to sow its brain-seed into the cortex of other brains, where it should germinate and grow, as mistletoe will grow, while the mother-tree gloried in the thought that the parasites in its crown were after all nothing but parasites.</p>

      <p>This kindled his ambition. To satisfy it he amassed knowledge and experience through study, travel and the intercourse with well-informed and distinguished men. And, surrounded by the everchanging chaos of inimical powers and interests, he sought his anchorage, the centre of the circle which life drew round him, in himself. Unlike the strengthless followers of Christ who seek a support outside themselves, in God, he clung to what in his inmost consciousness he held to be the truth and strove to grow into a perfect type of humanity, a man whose life and deeds should offend no one, in the certainty that the fruit of a well-pruned tree is bound to profit and delight all men.</p>

      <p>He carefully avoided the confusion, the errors which he saw in the efforts of those who professed to live for others while in reality they lived on others, the gratitude of fellow-creatures, the opinions and appreciation of society, and went his way without looking to right or left. He knew that one great and strong personality was of more use to the world than a whole army of irresponsible beings, whose number was in inverse ratio to their usefulness.</p>

      <p>His way of holding himself responsible for all his thoughts and acts carried him to a high standard of morality, for instead of leaving the settlement of accounts to a dim future, he made it a rule to settle with himself forthwith; refusing to cast his sins upon an innocently suffering Christ, and conscious of his own responsibility, he committed no actions which would be likely to rouse his desire for a scapegoat.</p>

      <p>This taught him to rely on no one but himself, never to act on anybody's advice, and always to consider the probable consequences of an action.</p>

      <p>But in spite of all this, like all his generation, bred and born in the epoch of steam and electricity, he was a sufferer from nervous affections, a fact which was not strange when one considers that he was called upon to destroy millions of antiquated impressions stored in the brain-cells, carefully examine and reject a number of old fallacies, whenever he was faced with the necessity of forming a fresh opinion.</p>

      <p>It was the effort of re-construction which caused in the nervous system disorders for which alcoholism and the sexual excesses of our ancestors have been exclusively blamed. The symptom of the disease was an increased vigour, accompanied by exaggerated sensitiveness, the sensitiveness of the crab changing its shell, or the bird when it is moulting. It was the creation of a new humanity, or at least a new type of man, which appeared unhealthy to the eyes of the seniors because it was a type in formation. This, however, the seniors refused to admit, because they themselves claim to be the rule and call themselves sound, unaware of the fact that they are in a condition of disintegration.</p>

      <p>This nervous sensitiveness increased as the youth grew to manhood, because he was abstemious in eating and drinking and kept his sexual impulses under strict control. He considered it degrading to throw himself into the state of a lunatic or a savage by partaking of fermented liquor, and his mind was far too lofty to contemplate a fleeting relationship with an abandoned woman. But the result of his abstinence was an increased acuteness of his senses; he became so sensitive to unpleasant impressions that things frequently aroused his disgust which men with coarser senses would have enjoyed.</p>

      <p>He would be depressed for hours if his morning coffee was not strong enough; a discoloured billiard ball, or a dirty cue were sufficient reasons in themselves to make him leave a billiard room and seek amusement elsewhere; a badly dried glass filled him with loathing; his sense of smell told him when somebody had read the paper before him; he could see the perspiration left behind by human hands on the polished surface of a piece of furniture; he always opened the window when a servant had been tidying his room.</p>

      <p>But when he was travelling and under the stress of circumstances, he could close up all the channels which led from the senses to conception, and harden himself against all feelings of nausea.</p>

      <p>When he had completed the study of the natural sciences at the University, he was appointed assistant at the Academy of Sciences. Natural research was the least humiliating of all pursuits, because it was a study in which opinions played a far less prominent part than the collecting of material.</p>

      <p>In applying for this post he had been actuated by a desire to be able to take in at a glance all the products collected from the various kingdoms of nature and arranged under one roof, thus to fathom, perhaps, the great connexion between all things, if there were one, or the great chaos, which seemed to him more probable.</p>

      <p>His intentions, however, were soon discovered, especially as it was not long before he fell into the pitfall of proposing a rearrangement of the birds, on a different plan. His superiors who, of course, had no wish to be mere collectors of material for a young man, and were not over-pleased at being considered out of date, together with their work, took a quite natural dislike to the assistant who seemed to have no illusions about them.</p>

      <p>They administered a first snub by giving the intruder trifling tasks which were of small importance and offended his sense of beauty. One of them was the changing of the spirit in the collection of fishes for six months. At first the nauseating smell caused him severe physical discomfort; but no sooner had he overcome the unpleasant sensation, than he threw himself with avidity into the study of fishes, and, being a quick worker, he was, after six months, familiar with the whole of the enormous subject. But he had spent the winter in the semi-darkness of a cold and unclean kitchen, inhaling bad spirit, suffering from cold hands and contracting a chronic catarrh of the bladder.</p>

      <p>His next task was the writing of labels and tickets for the algae. While at the University, he had not taken lessons in caligraphy, and as he wrote a feeble and unsteady hand, his labels were rejected. This brought discredit upon him because it made him seem incompetent: he could not even write. For two months he attended a writing-school, and sat at home in the evenings, bent over text and copy book, until, at the end of that time, he had acquired a beautiful and legible handwriting. In addition to this he had vastly improved his acquaintance with the algae.</p>

      <p>His chiefs who had expected him to scorn the drudgery, soon perceived that he did not mean to be got rid of so easily, but on the contrary knew how to turn all affronts to his advantage, increased his knowledge, cleverly parried all rebuffs and, as a rule, managed to steer clear of unpleasantness.</p>

      <p>His increased skill in writing, however, was made a source of fresh humiliation, for now he was set to make clear copies of all official letters and documents. It was hoped that in so doing he would sink down to the miserable level of a mere copyist. He did the work without a word of complaint. But by simultaneously studying foreign languages, he gained an insight into the secrets of the great men, to which it was believed he held no key. He followed the scientific controversies of the time discussed in the letters, discovered the roads to the secret meeting places of the learned societies, became acquainted with the subterranean passages which led to distinctions and the chances of making one's discoveries bear fruit. He was invtilnerable; no sooner was he considered down in the dust, than he arose with fresh vigour, holding up his heatl all the more proudly.</p>

      <p>His double role of aristocrat and original thinker made him a solitary man. His name had no scientific ring; his way of dressing well and fashionably was considered proof of an unscientific mind by all those who remembered the ragged trousers of Berzelius; his patient submission, or what appeared as such, was considered a sign of inferiority; his thoughts on natural science were looked upon as the ravings of a poet.</p>

      <p>The authorities, regretting their evident mistake in vouchsafing him a glimpse behind the scenes, and determined to crush him, bethought themselves of a fresh task, a task which, until now, every new-comer had refused, and which was therefore called the touch-stone, or the stumbling-block. There was a collection of specimens of rock and minerals stowed away in one of the lofts, derived partly from donations and bequests, and partly from circumnavigations of the globe and foreign expeditions. As most of them had been thrown out as duplicates at a time when geology was still in its cradle, the growth and development of this science now necessitated renewed examination and careful sifting. The collection was kept in an attic under the tiles, in one huge heap, covered with dust and cobwebs.</p>

      <p>As Borg stood under the hot tiles on the first day, breathing the dust into his lungs, his spirits sank and he almost lost heart; but when, on the second day, he found a mineral which, in his opinion, was unknown, he at once became absorbed in his work.</p>

      <p>And now he made discoveries which completely shook his already tottering faith in the conventional doctrine of the universe. It was obvious that the rocks had not been classified by nature, but that the brain of man classified all things. Everything could be arranged and classified, provided a principle of classification be first established. He soon realised that in the present instance the principle adopted was not chosen from a common-sense point of view. And when the principle itself was only a debateable supposition like the theory that the primitive rocks are formed by fusion in terrific heat in contrast to the stratified rocks which are layers of sediment deposited by water, while yet the primitive rocks are stratified like the later, deposited, formations, he could not shut his eyes to the flimsiness of the whole conjecture; the system was founded on guess work.</p>

      <p>In the meantime he had analysed his mineral and found that it was an unknown one; he handed it to his chief who sent it to the Berlin Academy and succeeded in this way in having it called by his name. Borg received no word of thanks, was not even mentioned, and reaped nothing but taunts from his superior.</p>

      <p>Irritated and annoyed, he sent his next discovery to Lyell in his own name. His treatise was read before the English Geological Society, which enrolled him amongst its members.</p>

      <p>Colleagues and superiors ignored his success which, to a certain extent, had given his chief away, for the latter had taken the unknown mineral for a duplicate. The general dislike grew into hatred and very soon developed into persecution. He avoided his persecutors, was seen nowhere, and devoted himself to work.</p>

      <p>As the collection of minerals was gathered from all European countries, and Borg knew how to give to every fresh discovery the semblance of immediate advantage to the mining industry of each individual country, he succeeded in a very few years in being admitted into most of the learned societies of Europe, besides becoming a knight of the Italian Order of the Crown, the French Instruction Publique, the Austrian Order of Leopold, and the Russian Order of St Anne, second class.</p>

      <p>But nothing seemed to impress his fellow-workers ; their smile grew more pronounced at every distinction he won, although each was gained by sheer personal merit. When they could not deny the facts, they tried to detract from their significance; for the most part they pretended to be unaware of what had happened. This, however, did not prevent them from hunting in his trail for their own benefit.</p>

      <p>When at last, after seven years of harassing service, his father died and left him sole heir to all his estate, he resigned his position and resolved to travel. The general comment was that he had missed his vocation and was a failure; and in a very short time public opinion would have it that he had been dismissed.</p>

      <p>With a heart filled to the brim with boundless contempt he left his country to continue his studies abroad.</p>

      <p>In the Continental hotels and boarding-houses he met all sorts of men, and formed many new ties which the force of circumstances soon severed. But everywhere he found men of the same generation pronouncing the same views of the same things, giving the opinion of the majority as their own, uttering phrases instead of clothing their thoughts in words. He discovered that the ruminating masses merely repeated the thoughts of a few rare intellects. All the geologists, for instance, reiterated the views of Agassiz and Lyell, formulated in 1830 and 1840; all religious freethinkers quoted Renan and Strauss; all energetic politicians throve on Mill or Buckle; all those who talked of a new literature drew from Taine. Doubtless there were but a few great batteries possessing rheomotors and they, through the conducting wires called talents, set all these bells ringing.</p>

      <p>From hence it was but a short step to the science of psychology; he associated with spiritists, hypnotists and thought-readers, divining behind all their humbug a series of new discoveries which would surely transform the ways of men who now lived thoughtlessly like the beasts; which would, perhaps, be of value in adjusting the thought-apparatus and open our eyes to the understanding of this great and never ceasing struggle.</p>

      <p>The war which raged over views and opinions, what was it but a struggle for the power to set the brains of others in motion? To force the majority to think one's own thoughts? He had witnessed more than one scientific quarrel which ended in the triumph of an erroneous view, if the victor had a reputation and the majority on his side. He had watched many a political and religious fight closed by legislation which was in exact contradiction to all common-sense and justice; which sanctioned fundamental errors, to be inherited by the next generation as self-evident truths.</p>

      <p>The only thing which mattered was the enforcement of one's will. The sole motifs actuating the champion of certain views were self-interest and passion. The former was nothing but desire; desire for food and love; the possession of a certain power was essential if they were to be obtained. He who was not striving to win power was a weakling whose will to live had grown anaemic. This was the reason why all weaklings were everlastingly laying so much stress on their right; the right of the weak; yet there was but one mathematical justice, one categorical truth; its penetration, however, required a strong thought apparatus, capable of freeing itself from the delusions of self-interest and passion.</p>

      <p>As Borg examined his inmost heart and compared himself to a number of other men, he could not help admitting that through severe self-discipline he had emancipated his judgment to a high degree; that he possessed a highly developed instinct to seek abstract justice, the truth which exists in the essence of things. He called himself a friend of truth in its purest sense, without considering it requisite to cry his thoughts from the house tops, or wrong to answer an impertinent question by an untruth.</p>

      <p>To grasp as far as possible the organisation of the human animal, he made a special study of the psychology of the lower animals, working his way upward to mankind.</p>

      <p>In addition he started a ledger in which he entered all individuals who had crossed his path; relatives, nurses, servants, schoolfellows, colleagues, friends and chiefs; in short, all the people who had come within his circle of observation; this he elaborated by providing himself with papers and records concerning them, birth certificates and evidence given by their friends. He formed their equation and endeavoured to solve the problem of their lives.</p>

      <p>Here he had an immense material to work upon. When he had reduced the confusion to order, he came to the conclusion that men, like animals and vegetables, could be divided into great classes, according to the principle of classification. Through adopting more than one principle of division, he came very near to the truth and threw the fullest light possible on the object of his observation.</p>

      <p>He divided, for instance, humanity into three sub-divisions; the conscious, the self deceivers and the unconscious.</p>

      <p>The conscious, or initiated, formed the highest class; they had seen through the fraud, believed in nothing and nobody, were generally termed sceptics and were hated and feared by the self-deceivers; they recognised one another at once when they met, and called each other 'scoundrel' when they parted, each one ascribing to the other base motives.</p>

      <p>The self-deceivers included all pious souls, all hypnotic media, prophets, leaders of parties, politicians, charitable individuals, and the whole army of those feebly ambitious persons who pretend to devote their life to the service of humanity.</p>

      <p>To the third class belonged all children, most criminals, most women and some lunatics, all of whom he considered intermediary forms between man and mammal, unendowed with the capacity of differentiating between subject and object.</p>

      <p>Another principle of classification, the ontogenetical principle, gave him : children, young people, women, men.</p>

      <p>In the case of his countrymen he made a special point of ancestral race marks, drew a line of distinction between the inhabitants of North-Sweden and the people from the South, recognised' the Norwegian in the inhabitants of the Swedish border provinces Vermland and Bohuslan; saw the Finn in many a man from Norrland; discovered immigrated Germans, Jews and Gipsies, thereby often finding the key to a strange trait in a puzzling character.</p>

      <p>An additional principle of classification was a division according to the dominant characteristic of the individual. To the lowest group belonged all gluttons, drunkards and misers; next came the sensualists and all those who indulged in sexual excesses; then those governed by their emotions and, finally, all intelligent and thinking men; the latter formed the highest class.</p>

      <p>He developed this science to a high degree. After a considerable time he had acquired the capacity to gauge an individual's character or <i>form his equation</i>. To test the correctness of his observations, he used himself as an object of psychological experiment, vivisected himself, applied fontanels and fistulas; submitted to an unnatural, frequently unpleasant, spiritual diet, never, however, forgetting to steer clear of the mistake of looking upon himself and his life as the standard by which his fellow-creatures should be measured.</p>

      <p>When, finally, he was tired of his voluntary exile, and his body longed for its natural milieu, he returned home and looked out for a centre of activity. Since his occupation was more or less a matter of indifference to him, he applied for the post of a superintendent of  fisheries. And as nobody desired his close proximity, he was sent out as first man to the  Stockholm Archipelago.</p>

      <p>Axel Borg roused himself from the silent contemplation of his development, during which he seemed to have been bom again, passing once more through all the stages of his evolution. It showed him the way to his standpoint and enabled him, by the calculation of the data in his possession, to map out his future course, his probable goal, and the chances of succeeding in his enterprise.</p>

      <p>The pilot who during all this time had rowed about between the skerries, under the lee of the ice floes, and had come to the firm conviction that the superintendent was not quite right in his head, because he sat in his place like a statue with expressionless eyes looking inward, seized the opportunity and asked him whether he had not better row back to the harbour ?</p>

      <p>The superintendent nodded.</p>

      <p>He threw a last glance at the wonderful spectacle which presented itself to his eyes; he saw the ice floes swiftly approaching, saw them bursting, crowding together, jammed block against block, he saw them climbing one over the other, saw them stand on end, change and shift their horizontal positions, forming hills, mountains and valleys.</p>

      <p>Just such a spectacle must have been presented to the sightless world at the birth of the earth crust. So must the first skin of the earth, covering the boiling sea, have burst into pieces, floated away, turned upside down and formed primary rocks, islands, skerries and islets, which were nothing but huge masses of pack ice, gigantic ice-bergs, though consisting of a substance other than water. And above this story of the creation, re-enacted before his eyes, trembled the original, undivided white light of the ice, side by side with the deep blue of the water and the atmosphere, the first light which shone upon the darkness. The God of the story of the creation, who divided the light from the darkness, appeared to his enquiring spirit as a natural cause. Once more hiis ear caught the first attempts of the reptiles, now transformed into birds, to bring harmony into their notes, as they rose from the disc of water which shut him in, and in which he would always be the centre, wherever he might happen to be...</p>

      <p>The boat ran into the harbour and the smoke rising from the chimneys told him that it was time for his mid-day meal.</p>

      <h1 id="c06h01">CHAPTER VI</h1>

      <p>One Sunday morning Axel Borg was sitting at his open window. Early summer had come, tinting the water light blue, and painting the insignificant remnants of lichen and moss in the crevices with delicate shades of green. The flocks of birds had migrated to the north, and only isolated pairs of eider-ducks swam in the bays. The great solitude, as he called the Baltic, gripped his heart, as he watched vessel after vessel steering to the South, and recognised among the vivid colours of the foreign flags which, accidentally or congruously, were so much more brilliant than the Swedish, the poor blue and the faded yellow.</p>

      <p>The rebellious tricolour floated from a brig which carried timber from Norrland to sunny, populous coasts, in exchange for a cargo of wine and oranges. The effeminate danebrog of a schooner exporting butter fluttered in the wake of a powerful German mail-boat, whose white flag, framed by a mourning edge, showed the Imperial crown like an ace of spades in the red field. The blood-coloured flag of Great Britain, the bpanisk sunblind, the American cotton bedding, they were as many greetings from foreign nations, with whom he felt more at one than with the strangers he was compelled to call his countrymen, for he possessed the privilege of wearing on his dress coat all those colours; only to those of his own country he had no right.</p>

      <p>To-day he needed the encouragement which these reminders of his world-citizenship always afforded him, more than ever, for during the last few days he had been surrounded in his place of exile by open enmity. The resentment of the population had been aroused by his having taken steps to enforce a law which had come into operation some years before, but up to now had never been applied, a measure which provided for the use of a regulation mesh in all fishing nets. He had been met by determined resistance which had ended in open defiance, so that he had been compelled to call in the assistance of the police to seize the trawl nets.</p>

      <p>This was not done until he had exhausted every means in his power to make the people understand that the law had been dictated entirely by the solicitude of the State for the welfare of the people; he had endeavoured to make them realise that their senseless system of fishing would end in reducing their children ,to beggary, more especially in view of their unwillingness to divide their land among their sons, preferring to keep one in comparative aflBuence, so as to enable him to carry on the family.</p>

      <p>Nothing had availed; all measures were deemed malicious whims of a number of unemployed officials whom the people's money had put into a position to annoy them. It was useless to tell them that the agricultural class had forced the law through Parliament; the fishermen now denounced peasants and Government alike.</p>

      <p>Borg comprehended that he was dealing, in this fishing colony, with a remnant of primitive society, careless and reckless, without an inkling of the peasant's thought for the morrow and the next year. He had been talking to savages who hunted for two days and slept for eight. Like all savages, they possessed the negative faculty of suffering and bearing privation, without the positive one of improving their position by new inventions; they had, on the contrary, a decided instinctive dislike to all innovations. This betrayed their inability to adapt themselves to a higher stage of culture. All these fishermen were the dregs of the native race; they had been unable to hold their own in the struggle for the fertile river-valleys and shores of the inland seas, and had gone out, or been pushed out, towards the cliffs, where the vegetable soil ceased, and only the uncertain wave offered them the gambling chance of a precarious living. They were gamblers, as unreliable as Fortune herself, unscrupulous in their means, always taking little loans on account of the ever expected stroke of luck which a good wreck might bring them.</p>

      <p>They had hated the intruder from the very outset, for their blindness had prevented them from realising that his desire to improve their position and release them from drudgery, was rooted in his ambition. Thus, for instance, out of an old gimlet and some broken up sardine boxes he had contrived an automatic wind-gauge for the chief pilot whose business it was to furnish meteorological reports.</p>

      <p>But the chief pilot, far from adopting it, had put it away in an attic.</p>

      <p>He had wanted to be of assistance in cases of sickness, but his help and advice had been rejected. He had been anxious to teach the house-wives to stop the smoke from being driven down the chimneys by the erection of an old strömming barrel on the top, outside; but the women had merely grinned and continued to complain of the unavoidable smoke. He had advised a fisherman who had vainly attempted to grow potatoes, to manure the sand with sea-weed and the refuse of fish, a method which he had seen successfully practised by the people on the coast of England, but the fisherman had refused to listen to him. When he saw the remainder of the great strömming catches in the spring decaying from want of salt, he had made futile efforts to introduce a process which the inhabitants of the Faroe Islands adopt in the manufacture of cheese, that is to say, the pickling of what they require for their own needs in the ashes of seaweed.</p>

      <p>The only result of his efforts was that he was dubbed Dr Knowall, was considered a fool, and formed the standing topic of conversation whenever the women met to gossip over a cup of coffee, or the men gathered round the brandy bottle; even the children grinned at him when they passed him in the street. ' At first the disparity between what he really was and what he was supposed to be, struck him as merely amusing; but gradually, as enmity took the place of coldness, he became aware of an adverse influence on his spiritual well-being. A feeling as if a thunder cloud of opposite electricity were hanging over his head, disturbing his nervous fluid, trying to destroy it by rendering it ineffectual, took possession of him. It was as if the thoughts of all those people which culminated on him had power gradually to drag him down; were able to put such pressure on his self-esteem that the moment was sure to come when he would lose faith in himself and his intellectual superiority; when their opinion that he was the fool and they were the wise men would take hold of his brain and compel him to agree with them.</p>

      <p>While these thoughts came and went, a new object had glided into the forty-five degrees of horizon which he could control from his window. A gunboat, belonging to the Swedish fleet, which was steaming at half-speed under the lee of the island, furled her sails and let down her anchor. Through his spy-glass he watched the sailors moving about in apparent confusion but without the slightest jostling; every one of them hurried to his cleat, his rope, his halyard, as soon as the second oflGlcer blew his whistle. The straight sides of the vessel, the up and down stem, the plates of which seemed to diverge in all directions while yet their combined energies flowed towards the bowsprit; the sturdy, tubular shape of steam-pipe and funnel, the pulling of the masts against stays and shrouds, the circular muzzle of the gun; all these things betokened an accumulation of energies which were organised, controlled one another, co-operated with and counteracted one another. The contemplation of them changed his mood. The wedge-shaped iron hulk, in which fitness, restraint and moderation combined to form a magnificent whole, seemed to radiate strength and order. The thoughtful consideration of this thing of beauty was a greater source of enjoyment to him than the facile emotion which is awakened in the beholder by the mere outward contemplation of a fine work of art.</p>

      <p>His reflection brought him another gift from the small, floating, water-bound community. He felt invigorated as if he had found a support in this representative of power which, sanctioned by people and Government, with the aid of all the resources of civilisation and science, protected the more highly evolved from the barbarism which assailed them from below. It gave him satisfaction to see the ease with which two or three of those superior men, after a successfully passed examination, controlled and directed by means of a whistle a hundred or so of semi-savages, who were incapable of understanding anything they could not see.</p>

      <p>Borg had never been tempted to make that error of observation which is so common in these days, namely to believe that the lower classes find hardship in their inferior position and coarser way of living. He was very well aware of the fact that they stand exactly where they are able to stand; that they suffer as little from their baser condition as the fish in the depths of the sea suffer from the fact that they have not advanced to the state of the amphibia. As far as the coarse food went, he knew from experience that the fishermen, whom on one occasion he had invited to dinner, despised all food which did not fill their stomachs; he had seen them picking out of the bread basket the coarse rye-bread, leaving the finer wheat-bread untouched. He believed that starvation existed only side by side with misfortune, and even then only by a combination of coincidences, for provision was made by the poor-law, a social remedy constantly abused by loafers and rogues who feigned sickness in order to force the State to maintain them.</p>

      <p>He had never loved the poor; he had never felt a desire to bend his knee before the humble, although he was disowned by a society which, in a period of general decline, had risen to its rank by stolen merit and now pressed heavily on all those who strove to rise. He was not tempted, even now, to over-estimate this chance representative of the upper classes which, in the semblance of a gun-boat, partly commanded his admiration, partly appeared to him as a remnant of a governing principle which ruled others by means of gas and Bessemer cylinders.</p>

      <p>A door slammed beneath him, and the newcomer set all tongues wagging. It was Oeman, whose drag net had been seized. He heard the jingling of brandy glasses, and the noise increased as yesterday's intoxication was repeated.</p>

      <p>'Idiots and enemies of the people who think that they know more than experienced fishermen ! Who lie on the sofa all day long reading books, and cost us two thousand crowns! Snivelling brats who think they can teach their elders! Thieves and cigarette heroes with pigtails under their noses . . .'</p>

      <p>The abuse was cut short by a veritable  breaker which broke on Vestman's information, founded on facts which he had gleaned on board the <i>Jacok Bagge</i>, concerning the superintendent's family, the irregular sexual relationships of his father, the low origin of his mother; hints that the superintendent had been dismissed from his previous post, and so on.</p>

      <p>The listener endeavoured to make himself deaf and indifferent as he had so often done before, but the words bit into his soul, polluted him, hurt him against his will. Old doubts of his father's integrity, of his own worthi-ness, awoke; the fear of being unable to keep his skin dry in this rain of mud, of succeeding in avoiding a fight, in which he might be worsted on account of his delicacy in the choice of weapons.</p>

      <p>The bell went on the gun-boat, the rpUing of drums came across the water, and the summer breeze wafted the grave, rhythmical, devout notes of an old hymn, sung by a hundred throats, to the shore. But from bebw came noise and threats and ominous growls, as from the cages of a menagerie. In the pauses of the song the growling grew into furious yells, for the party had split on the question whether or not the drag net should be recovered by force.</p>

      <p>Axel Borg, who looked upon churches as archaeological institutes, or interesting buildings of past times, like pagodas, suddenly remembered a few words uttered one night by a young clergyman during a discussion on Christian divine service. 'I don't believe in the divinity of Christ, or anything else,' he had said, *but take my word for it, there must be a check on the mob.'</p>

      <p>'There must be a check on the mob,' he repeated in thought, but his reverie was rudely interrupted by the sounds of a scuffle which had broken out below. Chairs were overturned, heavy heels kicked the furniture; a din like the bellowing of cattle mingled with the hissing of reptiles filled the air, and above all shrilled the voice of a woman who seemed to. pour forth hundreds of words a minute.</p>

      <p>The steamer whistled, the anchor was weighed, the sails hoisted and the funnel threw a jet-black cloud against the blue vault of the sky. With a sensation of regret, not unmixed with uneasiness, Borg watched the boat with the pretty gun disappearing in the South. It seemed to him that he had lost a support; that hatred was coming nearer and enveloping him like a sack. He wanted to fly, regardless whereto.</p>

      <p>A child began to cry, he did not know whether from fear or pain, for during the tumult he had crept downstairs, walked to the harbour, unmoored his boat, and was rowing seawards as fast as he could.</p>

      <p>The skerry which he was leaving behind was the most eastern of a tiny archipelago, which had not interested him so far and which he was now exploring for the first time, prompted by the necessity of being alone.</p>

      <p>He had never learnt to row; he had a dislike of violent exercise, partly because he considered it superfluous on account of the endless variety of machines and vehicles, and partly because he thought it harmful to the function of his nervous and sensory systems, for the delicate instruments enclosed in the brainpan are as unable to bear concussion, as the building which contains the astronomical instruments of precision. But his sense of rhythm and his well-balanced motor centres made him a skilled rower, and his knowledge of physics taught him to improve the ancient sport by raising the seat and thereby saving muscular energy.</p>

      <p>As the skerry disappeared in the distance, he began to breathe more freely. When he landed at the first cliff, he experienced an indescribable feeling of happiness. It was a light, flat, long expanse of island; the rocks on the shore consisted of grey gneiss and formed a tiny harbour. The water was as transparent as condensed liquid air; the delicately tinted sea-weed shone at the bottom as if it were encased in a block of refined glass. The boulders on the shore were washed and polished, and offered a diversity of colours which never tired, for not two of them were alike. Between them reed-millet and sedge had found supports for their tiny hillocks. In the hollows of the gently sloping rocks lay sea-gulls' eggs, in threes, embedded in moss, coffee-brown with black spots, while the mother-birds screamed and laughed above Borg's head.</p>

      <p>The superintendent went on climbing and reached a pile of stones erected by the surveyor of the sea and flecked with white by sea-gulls and swallows. Junipers grew here, spread out like a carpet, and an invading army of delicate white chickweed had improvised a camp between them; it was a union of the mountain glens of Central Europe and the shadows of the Northern forests. The little sea-dotterel, bold and gay, fluttered restlessly to and fro, endeavouring to divert the attention of the intruder from its nest.</p>

      <p>No shrub, no tree shook its crown above the half-barren rocks. The absence of shadows, of hiding-places, made the visitor light-hearted and glad. Everything on this rock could be seen at a glance, showed itself openly to the brilliant light of the sun. And the sea, which separated him from his home among the savages whom he had just left behind, seemed to surround him with an unsurmount-able barrier of clear transparency. The semi-arctic, semi-alpine landscape with its primitive formation refreshed him and calmed his mind.</p>

      <p>When he had rested a little while, he returned to his boat and rowed on. He passed three highly polished cliffs which looked like petrified waves, naked as a hand, without a trace of organic life.</p>

      <p>They interested him from a scientific point of view; he wondered how they had come into existence.</p>

      <p>His boat glided past a flat skerry of reddish gneiss which boasted, to leeward, a mountain-ash, a hundred years old, solitary, gnarled, covered with moss. A water-wagtail, for want of a tiled roof or stone-wall, had built its nest in the lacerated trunk. The coquettish little bird flew down to the shore and tried to persuade the enemy that the island harboured neither a nest nor little grey-white eggs.</p>

      <p>The solitary mountain-ash grew on a grassy spot of several square yards, and looked not only very lonely but also unusually strong, from lack of competition; it found it more easy to defy gales, salt and bitter cold, than envious competitors who contest every inch of soil. The lonely patriarch attracted Borg, and for a fleeting moment he was conscious of a desire to build a cottage close by. But he rowed past and the impression wore off.</p>

      <p>Now a dark cliff appeared behind the headland of the last rocky island. It was coal-black, the effect of the volcanic mineral diorite. As he drew near, a feeling of uneasiness came over him. The black, crystallised mass looked as if it had been thrown up from the bottom of the sea, and as soon as it had begun to grow rigid, engaged in a titanic fight with the water, or a thunder-cloud, for it was split into eight parts; sea and ice had washed away the fragments ; or, perhaps, they had sunk to the bottom of the sea. The black, glittering walls stood up steeply, perpendicularly. As Borg moored his boat beneath them, his uneasiness increased; he felt as if he were in a coal-mine, or a sooty forge.</p>

      <p>When he had climbed the summit, he was faced by a pole which carried on its top a small, white-washed barrel. There was something disturbing, something alarming and brutal in this trace of human handiwork out here where no men lived; this triple memory of gallows, shipwreck and coal-mine; this crude contrast between the fimdamental black and white, between sterile, violent nature, innocent of all organic life,—for the whole formation bore no sign of moss or lichen,— and this piece of carpentry on the primitive rocks. In the great Sunday stillness he heard below his feet, where fallen boulders had formed a roof over a cleft, the rushing of the waves into a cavity which extended almost to the centre of the skerry, driving the air before them, lashing it until it roared and bellowed, and receding again with a hollow, sobbing moan.</p>

      <p>He stood still for a moment, amused at his uneasiness, dwelling on older sensations which had always excited in him an unpleasant feeling; he smelt the smoke of burning coal, saw factories and black, discontented men and women : they uttered words which tried to force a way through his ears into his brain, there to germinate and grow into weeds which would choke the good seed, transform the field which he had cultivated with so much care and trouble into a natural meadow.</p>

      <p>When he re-entered his boat and turned his back on the sinister scene, he was again conscious of a feeling of delight as he looked at the infinite purity of the water, the blue void, which lay before his eyes like a clean slate, lulling his spirit to rest because it could not awaken old memories, evoke new inspirations or move him to any strong feeling whatever. And as he approached a somewhat larger islet, he greeted it as if it were a new acquaintance, a person who would have news for him and so efface the moods which had just swept over his soul.</p>

      <p>More reefs and skerries swam past; each one of them had a new surprise, possessed individual features. But frequently the differences were so minute that it required a trained eye to see them. These tiny mountains which, glanced at from the swiftly passing boat, looked so barren, so deadly monotonous, offered to a closer inspection a rich and varied spectacle, just as the varieties of a given coin are only obvious to the eye of the numismatist.</p>

      <p>He went ashore on one of the larger islets, attracted by its irregular, ragged look and the leafy tree tops which towered above the cliffs. When he had climbed the summit of the northern mountain, whose black base had been washed clean by the seas, he noticed that the island was composed of at least four skerries, which seemed to have been blown together by winds from different quarters and, on account of the accumulation of many geological formations, created a conglomerate of landscapes borrowed from all the zones of the earth.</p>

      <p>The northern part consisted of a cone of hornblende slate which, on the sea shore, was cleft into almost incredible shapes. The blocks had fallen from the mountain-side and had not yet been polished by the water.</p>

      <p>Between these black boulders, as if attracted to them by a mysterious bond, grew an extraordinary quantity of black currants, sinister in colour and matching the dark, glittering stone. To meet these elegantly arrayed runaways from the garden out here in the wilderness was something so unexpected, that it suggested that nature had been playing a practical joke. Perhaps a wounded wood-cock had held the berries in its beak as it flew here to die, and so had brought with it the seed of a new culture.</p>

      <p>Higher up, among the heap of boulders, grew a copse of trees with light green foliage, the crowns of which were cut into shape and their trunks whitened as if a tending human hand had white-washed them. He tried to guess the species from a distance, but the trees diilered so much from all those he had seen growing in these latitudes, that his thoughts wavered between acacias, beeches and Japanese varnish-trees, so common in Southern Europe. He refused to trust his ears as he caught the well-known rustling of the common poplar, but as he approached, dodging an adder which glided past him like a rivulet and disappeared between two stones, he became aware that his ears had not deceived him. It was the stately, pretty poplar of our groves and copses, which north-wind and stony ground, drift ice and sea-salt had modified and altered until they had achieved a variety hardly recognisable. In the struggle with rough weather and bitter cold it had grown grey towards the top, had lost its crown, and therefore consisted of nothing but frost-bitten off-shoots which had burst into leaf again and again, persistently renewing themselves, while the goats had peeled off the protecting bark, allowing the sap to run away. There was eternal youth in these delicate, light green off-shoots of the grey, branch-less trunks representing a hoary old age, without the intermediary prime of life : a malformation which was refreshing because it was novel and unconventional.</p>

      <p>When he had climbed over the sharp stones and reached the very top, he felt as if he had, in ten minutes, accomplished the ascent of a Swedish mountain. He had left the region of the foliage trees behind; the plateau of the mountain presented an alpine flora : the alpine variety of the juniper flourished here side by side with the true northern cloud-berry which grew in the white moss of the damp gullies, and here and there specimens of the small dogberry tree, perhaps the only plant peculiar to Sweden and the Swedish archipelago, struggled for existence.</p>

      <p>He slowly descended the southern declivity through cranberries and bearberries, red millet and sedge, wool-grass and swelling moss, until he came to a ravine. Here the cliff had been rent asunder, and a channel flowed between the black walls.</p>

      <p>The obtrusive auks rose with wild screams as he crossed the shallow channel by a natural stone bridge and gained the opposite cliff which was of a lighter formation and formed the entrance to another section of the wonderful island.</p>

      <p>The light, elegant eurite, the strata of pale pink felspar, the light, bluish-green quartz, the presence of mica which was betrayed by a faint shimmer resembling microscopic hoarfrost, lent an appearance of gaiety to the little landscape and offered, with its countless clefts and fissures, at every step new stone couches and armchairs. A strong vein of granular white limestone ran, like a belt, through the whole formation; the fertile rubble, crumbled off by rain and frost, had collected below, between the fairly high mountain sides. Spread out before him was a valley of such entrancing loveliness, that Borg at first stood still with amazement and then sat down on a stone stool to enjoy the unexpected sight. Between the mountain walls which rose perpendicularly from the meadow, was a grassy level studded with flowers more exquisitely and luxuriantly beautiful than those of the continent; the scarlet geranium had climbed down from the mountain to seek moisture and warmth below; the honey-white navelwort from the damp sedge pool held a tryst with the blue and yellow cow-wheat from the wood; the southern orchids, perhaps brought hither by the wind from the wine-country, Gotland, grew in abundance. The hyacinthine elder-orchis, the magnificent helm-orchis, the stately bird-of-the-wood, a kind of glorified lily-of-the-valley, had found a hothouse constructed by nature herself out of the forcing lime, the moist air, the sheltering walls and the luxuriant grass.</p>

      <p>The mountains in the background were covered with birches and alder trees which raised their crowns timidly, without daring to venture too near the haunts of the winds. Scattered profusely all over the grass were guelder-roses, their white balls drooping over the foliage, so closely resembling vine-leaves. Clinging to the mountain side, as if it were trellis work, bloomed the glossy, dark green buckthorn, with leafage which is not unlike the much lauded orange tree, but possesses more sap, richer tints, more delicate tracery and a far more sensitive structure.</p>

      <p>It was a park, an inland garden swimming out here on the waves. As his eye, throijgh a cleft in the mountain, or a depression, caught sight of the blue, horizontal line of the sea, the striking contrast brought home to him the almost miraculojis beauty of the sight.</p>

      <p>He sat down, listening to the spring song of a chaffinch, interrupted every now and then by the screaming and croaking of the sea-gulls and guillemots. Solitude soothed him like a deep sleep. The birds were hushed for a moment, and only a faint breeze whispered through the crowns of the birch-trees without dropping to the lower branches, when suddenly the stillness was broken by a cough. He started and looked round, but could see no sign of a human presence.</p>

      <p>The hollow sound from a human breast speaking of suffering, in this silent landscape, awoke him with a shock and brought round dressed in a well-cut, fashionable dress; a white table-cloth was spread on the ground, a basket, containing food and a butter-cooler of Swedish marble, was placed in the centre of the table-cloth. By the side of the ladies sat a man from the skerries, obviously the boatman, in shirt sleeves, eating a piece of bread and butter. Before the embarrassed man stood a girl offering him, with a mock curtsey, a glass of beer, the curves of the dying laughter still on her lips.</p>

      <p>Borg was immediately fascinated. Although his common-sense whispered to him that she was flirting with the lout, he felt irresistibly attracted by her dark olive skin, her black eyes and her fine figure. Certainly, she was not the first woman who had pleased him at first sight, but she belonged to a type which never failed to attract him. He could not ascribe his quick response to the solitude and his lack of female society. He felt exactly the same pleasure when, for instance, he had been trying to buy a tie of a certain shade and, after wearily trudging from shop to shop, suddenly came upon it in a shop window. The oppression was lifted as soon as his thoughts whispered to him : This is the right one!</p>

      <p>He hesitated for a moment, undecided whether to approach and introduce himself, or whether to turn back. A slight movement betrayed him. The girl, who saw him first, dropped her arm to her side and stared at the unexpected apparition with the look of a frightened child, which encouraged the intruder to draw near and reassure the small party with an explanation.</p>

      <p>He raised his hat and advanced.</p>
