      <br /></h1>

      <p>AFTER the first attempt with the drift net it had rained for a week.</p>

      <p>The only result of the excursion had been a little scene between the fiancés. Borg had purposely played a trick upon the young people, for he was well aware that not a fish was to be caught. As he met the imsuccessful expedition at the shore, his fiancde, haggard with her vigil, called him an idiot. The boatmen grinned and the assistant, dreading a quarrel, made a joke of the whole affair.</p>

      <p>At dinner the nagging about the new method of fishing had re-commenced; Borg had pretended to be so overwhelmed with remorse that Mr Blom had repeatedly taken his part and defended him in a very tactless manner.</p>

      <p>The rainy days had kept the party indoors. A relationship of great intimacy had sprung up in the ladies' cottage. The assistant had introduced the custom of reading aloud from Swedish poets. At first Borg had been one of the audience, but finally he had stayed away on the plea that Swedish literature was only fit for women and candidates for confirmation, and that he preferred to wait for a poet who wrote for men. He was unanimously pronounced unable to appreciate poetry; but he was well content; henceforth he was exempt from the readings.</p>

      <p>The rainy weather had also interrupted the work at the chapel.</p>

      <p>The workmen sat in the cottages and treated their hosts with brandy, in exchange for coffee.</p>

      <p>The preacher, unable to hold any meetings on the hill, visited at first kitchen after kitchen, attempting to read to the people. But he was received with indifference, and he quarrelled with the men from the town who were for the most part free-thinkers. Ultimately he remained in his room, pleading sickness, and sent to Borg for another bottle of quinine as the first one was finished. All of a sudden he disappeared, and a rumour went round the skerry that he had left by the steamer for the mainland.</p>

      <p>After a few days he returned in the company of a man he called brother; they brought with them a miscellaneous cargo. This cargo, the greater part of which consisted of beer, was stored in a sea-booth. Two barrels were placed in the open door, and a board laid across; this represented the counter. And so the shop was opened, the community having given permission.</p>

      <p>For some little time there had been a steady invasion of the fishing population of the islands nearer to the mainland. All the booths were opened and let to the strangers. The cottages were crowded with friends and relations. The life and animation which prevailed everywhere formed a strange contrast to the usual silence and desolation.</p>

      <p>As the skerry and the right of fishing in the shallows belonged to a private individual in the North, each boat paid a certain duty, collected by an official appointed by the owner. A coolness had sprung up between the Superintendent and this man at the moment the former had mentioned fishing with drift nets. For in this case the fishermen would abandon the shallows and no longer pay the water-shilling.</p>

      <p>But Borg had known how to turn even this, apparently unfavourable, circumstance to his advantage : the official who from dislike of innovations made propaganda for the good old customs, supported by liberal oblations of brandy, should be compelled to form the dark back-ground against which the new method should stand out all the more brilliantly. Borg was certain of victory; he had made water tests at all hours of the day and night; he had worked with his dredge and examined the depths with his sea-glass in order to find out where the stromming was most abundant.</p>

      <p>All these details had no other object than that of keeping him in training for future battles, restoring to him the feeling of authority, essential to all those who possess genius; talents which are allowed to lie fallow are soon lost.</p>

      <p>The increasing insolence of the two young people had accustomed Borg to play the part of the vanquished. He was on the point of actually becoming the part he played, more especially as he did not wish to bring about the rupture but judged it wiser that the decisive step should be taken by the other side.</p>

      <p>The young couple were in every respect in perfect sympathy. Borg had daily evidence that the mature woman stood on the same mental level as the immature man; she accepted all his unripe ideas, his crude opinions, as the acme of wisdom. Borg's attempts to prevent acts of folly were invariably wrecked by the inability of both Marie and the assistant to see a question from more than one side. They were completely under the spell of their desire to possess each other. He had no wish to compete in gymnastics, or in composing panegyrics on the inferior sex; it suited his game to be cut out; it would end a connexion which threatened to ruin his whole future. He was painfully conscious of the anomalous relationship whenever he spent a few undisturbed hours in his fiancée's society; on those occasions he saw nothing but reflections of his rival; felt his breath on her lips, as it were; heard her re-echo his inanities. He loathed this relationship, reminiscent of a ménage à trois.</p>

      <p>The vanity of the assistant was without limits; he believed himself head and shoulders above the superintendent because he was on a level with Miss Marie, who on her part tried to hypnotise people into the belief that she excelled Borg. According to the formula : if A is greater than B, and C is as great as A, then C, too, is greater than B, he was right. But he never thought of examining first whether A really was greater than B.</p>

      <p>It would have been impossible, so Borg thought, to find a more complete revelation of the secret of youth. He recognised a stage in his evolution which he had left far behind. How he had wept with ambition and desire! How envy of his elders who had won what he was still striving for and now kept him down, had filled him with despair! How he had sympathised with all those who were oppressed and of no importance! What monstrous inability to gauge one's own strength was betrayed by the yearning to grasp in a moment what only a life-time could bestow! What a mountain of sentimentality which was nothing but unsatisfied desire! What an exaggerated opinion of women, because nursery and mother were still fresh in the memory!</p>

      <p>He even recognised the attempts to come to a better understanding; attempts of the fox to succeed through cimning, resembling the notorious cunning of women, priests and lawyers.</p>

      <p>The young man had tried thought-reading with the superintendent, betraying thereby that he gave him credit for mysterious knowledge which would explain the difference between him and other men. But he had been so clumsy in his method that he had let out what the ladies thought and said about him. Instead of giving him the smallest enlightenment, Borg had mystified him by his answers, so that he began to wonder whether his chief was a fool or a demon. By demon he meant a man conscious of his power, who under the cloak of simplicity, acted with great shrewdness, was always wide awake, and influenced the lives of others, so that they should serve his own ends. And as shrewdness, which is a virtue, is in discredit with the young who cannot foresee the consequences of an act, the assistant's envy showed itself in the passionate desire of the inferior mind to drag down what it cannot comprehend, and trample it under foot.</p>

      <p>This was the state of affairs when the great day dawned which was to decide the fate of the natives during the coming winter.</p>

      <p>A sultry August evening brooded over the skerrvs the sun had set but cliffs and stones were warm, so warm that no dew had as yet fallen. The sea was smooth and grey as lavender. A coppery full moon was rising and was just now half hidden by a brig steering, apparently, straight for the satellite's <i>mare serenitatis</i>. The floats lay in rows on the shore, looking like flocks of sea-birds rocking themselves on the swell.</p>

      <p>The people, armed with coffee kettles and brandy bottles, were lying roimd camp fires, awaiting the dawn to examine their nets.</p>

      <p>In the booth, where beer was being sold, business was very brisk, and the preacher was lending a hand; he wore a blue apron and opened beer bottles with the skill of an old innkeeper.</p>

      <p>Borg had observed current, temperature and barometer, and was now strolling along the sandy shore to rest his brain. Every now and then he came upon a couple who had sought solitude. Their conduct was so incredibly naive that he turned away with a contemptuous smile. When he had reached the headland, he climbed on the cliff to find his favourite seat. It was a stone chair, smoothly polished by the waves, and after the scorching sunshine of the day still hot as an oven.</p>

      <p>He had been sitting there for a little while, lulled into drow^siness by the sighing waves, when he heard a crunching of sand and a ratr tling of the dry sea-weed. The assistant and his fiancfe were strolling along the shore with their arms round each other. They stood still between the invisible observer and the shining path of moonlight which lay on the water. He saw their silhouettes as distinctly as if he ivere examining them between lens and reflector of his microscope. With the keen eye of antipathy he saw her bird-of-prey profile approaching the gorilla head of her companion, with its huge trumpeter's cheeks and the cone-shaped narrow skull which possessed no forehead. He noticed the man's fleshy figure, the ignoble lines and large feminine hips, reminiscent of the Farnese Hercules : an ideal man of a semi-human period, when the fist ruled because the cerebrum had not been completely evolved.</p>

      <p>He was deeply wounded. It was as if he had formed a union with a female centaur, as if his soul had entered into a relationship with a deteriorated type. A crime might debase his family for all time; he might sacrifice his life for another man's child; waste his love on the offspring of a stranger; and if he should take this child to his heart, he would have to carry with him his humiliation as if it were a leaden weight forged to his ankle, without ever being able to free himself.</p>

      <p>Jealousy, this `base vice,' what was it but the fear of the healthy, strong sexual instinct of being checked in its praiseworthy egoistic desire to carry on all that was best in the individual? And was not every individual endowed with this healthy passion ? It was not merely a characteristic of the sterile main-tainer of a family, the weak fool, the Cicisbeo, the gynolatrist, believing in Platonic love.</p>

      <p>Borg was jealous. But his resentment gradually abated and finally gave way to an irresistible desire to possess this girl without marrying her. War had been declared, the freedom of choice had been proclaimed. What if he took up the glove, tore his bonds and appeared as a lover? The battle won, he could go his way in peace, serene in the consciousness that he was not one of nature's failures, destined to be beaten in the struggle for love. It was no longer a case of an honest competition; it was a treacherous duel between burglars; the challenger's weapon was a jemmy; they fought for stolen goods. The prize was a woman; all scruples had vanished. The beast was roused; the savage instincts, concealing themselves under the sacred name of love, raged like natural forces let loose.</p>

      <p>He left his cliff unperceived and went home <i>to arrange his fate</i>.</p>

      <p>On the following morning at seven o'clock dead silence reigned on the skerry; as the superintendent had predicted, the catch in the shallows had been a failure. The men were sitting in their boats, despondent, straightening their nets from which they picked a solitary stromming every now and then and threw it on the shore.</p>

      <p>With the sinking credit the traffic before the shop had ceased. The preacher had taken off his blue apron and, bible in hand, had gathered round him a handful of despairing women in one of the cottages.</p>

      <p>With the extraordinary logic which is not at all uncommon among his class, he related how Jesus had fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fishes. It was easy to draw a parallel, for there were many mouths and few fish on the skerry; but how all these mouths were to be filled, he could not tell. He was unable to help; consequently he had to explain how it was that the miracle could not happen again. It was want of faith. If their faith were but the size of a mustard seed, the miracle would be repeated. Faith was the reward of prayer. I^t them join him in prayer.</p>

      <p>None of the women present believed in the miracle of the two fishes; they had never heard or read about it; nevertheless they followed the preacher's example and recited with him the Lord's prayer, which they had learnt fairly well when they were candidates for confirmation.</p>

      <p>When they were half way through, they were interrupted by the murmur of many voices on the shore. Those who were nearest to the window saw a fishing boat lowering her square sail and coming alongside the landing stage.</p>

      <p>Miss Marie stood in the bow, her blue tam-o'-shanter perched on her head, her hair fluttering in the wind. The assistant sat at the helm and signalled with his hat that they had been successful. The boat was laden with nets. Through the dark meshes glittered fish on fish.</p>

      <p>'Come along, all of you !' exclaimed the girl, with the generosity of the conqueror, 'we've plenty of strömming for everybody.'</p>

      <p>'The people may have it as soon as I have measured it,' interposed the Superintendent who had watched the return of the boat from his window, and had come down to the shore to see the result of his work.</p>

      <p>'What do you want to measure it for ?' asked Miss Marie, superciliously.</p>

      <p>'For the statistics, Your High-and-Mighti-ness,' replied the Superintendent without a trace of anger; he knew that the successful catch was due to his information on current, depth, temperature of the water, and the condition of the bottom of the sea.</p>

      <p>'Oh! You and your statistics!' laughed Marie, contemptuously.</p>

      <p>'Do as you like, then, but let me know later on how much it was.' And without another word Borg returned to his room.</p>

      <p>Marie turned to the assistant. 'He's envious,' she said.</p>

      <p>'Jealous?' suggested the assistant.</p>

      <p>'He hasn't got it in him,' answered the girl, under her breath. Her fiancé's indifference to his rival had been a source of irritation to her for days; she read in it a positively insulting faith in his power of retaining her affection.</p>

      <p>The prayer meeting had been interrupted; the natives were congregating round the fishing boat.</p>

      <p>'Really, the young lady is a splendid fellow!' flattered the preacher, seizing the opportunity, as he thought, to sow the seeds of discord.</p>

      <p>'A sitting crow gets no food,' laughed the inspector.</p>

      <p> He means one who lies on the sofa,' whispered the assistant in Marie's ear.</p>

      <p>The girl seemed to swell with pride and freely distributed the fish among the people on the landing stage, who never ceased calling down blessings on their good angel.</p>

      <p>But these fine emotions were not so much bom of gratitude for benefits received, as unwillingness on the part of the people to admit that they had been wrong and the Superintendent, at whose method they had scoffed, right.</p>

      <p>It was the reverse of the hatred they nursed for th^ir real benefactor to whom they would not give thanks.</p>

      <p>When the fish had been taken out of the nets and distributed among the very poor, it filled ten barrels. They were at once bought up by the shop to be pickled and the money was spent on the spot on coffee, sugar and beer. After Miss Marie had explained the new method in detail, no one doubted that it would be easy to catch sufficient strömming for home consumption during the winter.</p>

      <h1 id="c16h01">CHAPTER XVI</h1>

      <p>BoRG found a letter in his room which had been brought by a Customs official. The officers of the corvette Loke, which was to anchor close to the skerry at eight o'clock that night, were inviting him and his fianc6e to a dance.</p>

      <p>He realised that the moment for the rupture had come; it was impossible to introduce another man's mistress as his future wife. He slipped off his engagement ring and enclosed it in a letter, written on the previous evening and addressed to Marie's mother. In it he expressed in the strongest terms his despair at having to abandon all hope of making Marie his wife; a previous reckless entanglement had culminated in the birth of a child; the baby's mother was legally entitled to claim his assistance, and although she could not compel him to marry her, the matter would stand in the way of his forming any other alliance. As a man of honour he was bound to stand by the victim of his passion, shield her from disgrace and save her from want.</p>

      <p class="illus"><img alt="picture1" src="../Images/picture1.jpg" /></p>

      <p>This fictitious story seemed to him the only possible way of breaking off his engagement. The reputation of both of them, more particularly the girl's, remained uncompromised; moreover it was final and left no hope of a reconciliation.</p>

      <p>He sealed the letter, whistled for his orderly and gave it to him with instructions to deliver it to the old lady.</p>

      <p>When the man had gone, he lighted a cigarette and took a seat near the window to watch the effect of his strategy.</p>

      <p>The old lady was standing in the porch, shaking a rug, when the messenger arrived with the letter. She seemed a little surprised, and her surprise grew when she felt the envelope with her left hand to ascertain its contents. Then she turned round and went into the cottage.</p>

      <p>A moment later he saw Marie's figure behind the curtain. She was pacing the room excitedly, standing still every now and then and gesticulating wildly, evidently trying to clear herself of a charge.</p>

      <p>This continued for about an hour. Then she came out, threw a revengeful glance at Borg's window, and beckoned to the assistant who was coming up from the harbour.</p>

      <p>Both re-entered the cottage and remained</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>invisible for half an hour; suddenly they reappeared and went to a wooden shed from which they produced a trunk and a portmanteau.</p>

      <p>It was obvious that they had come to a decision, and realised that they could stay no longer on the skerry.</p>

      <p>After a little while the assistant emerged by himself; this time he fetched his own portmanteau which Borg recognised by its brass mounts.</p>

      <p>So he, too, meant to leave.</p>

      <p>Presently landlord and servants arrived on the scene; the whole house seemed to be turned upside down.</p>

      <p>Borg whiled away the next few hours with a book. Towards noon he saw Marie and the assistant coming out of the cottage. They were in the middle of a lively conversation which grew more and more lively as it proceeded, and was accompanied by gestures which plainly betrayed the fact that they were squabbling.</p>

      <p>'They're already quarrelling,' thought Borg.</p>

      <p>In the afternoon the pilot's boat took the old lady and the assistant to the town-bound steamer. Borg could not understand why Marie remained behind. Perhaps she nursed</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>a faint hope of reconciliation, perhaps she wanted to defy him, perhaps something else was in her mind.</p>

      <p>She was sitting in the window in a place where he could see her from his room. She remained there nearly the whole time, now drumming on the window panes, now taking up a book, now burying iier face in her handkerchief.</p>

      <p>At seven o'clock in the evening the corvette appeared on the fairway from Landsort, and soon after she cast anchor among the skerries. When she signalled with her steam-whistle to the pilot, the girl rose and went outside to see what was the matter.</p>

      <p>Borg watched her as she stood on the hill, gazing with fascinated eyes at the trim vessel with its large tent between decks, decorated with bunting. Her hands crossed behind her back, she looked the picture of unhappiness. Now the breeze wafted the first bars of a march to her ears. Her feet began to move in time; slowly her slim body bent forward, as if drawn by the spell of the music. But all of a sudden she collapsed, covered her face with her hands, and rushed back to the cottage in despair, like a child robbed of an expected treat.</p>

      <p>Axel Borg dressed for the dance. He put</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>on his SIX orders and the bangle which he had not worn since the day of his engagement.</p>

      <p>When he had finished dressing and found that he had still an hour to spare before the boat would come for him, he resolved to call on Marie and bid her a last farewell. He did not want to be thought a coward, and also,i he wanted to test his power of controlling (his emotions.</p>

      <p>He entered the hall a little noisily, so as to give her time for a pose which should allow him to guess why she had remained behind and what were her intentions.</p>

      <p>He knocked at the door and entered. Marie was sewing; he had never seen her occupied in this waj'' before. Her face expressed contrition, remorse and humility, in spite of her effort to look indifferent.</p>

      <p>*May I come in, Miss Marie, or shall I go ?' asked Borg.</p>

      <p>Once more he felt that inexplicable yearning to raise her above himself as his wife, a yearning he always felt whenever she came to him invested with womanly characteristics and the desire to lean on him just as he always experienced an uncontrollable desire to strike her down whenever she put forth a man's claims with the demeanour of a man. At this moment she appeared to him more beautiful</p>

      <p>D</p>

      <p>27S BY THE OPEN SEA</p>

      <p>than he had seen her for a long time; he gave way to his feelings and spoke to her, frankly :</p>

      <p>*IVe hurt you, Miss Marie . . .*</p>

      <p>At his gentle words she straightened herself and answered venomously:</p>

      <p>*But you were too great a coward to tell me so to my face !'</p>

      <p>'Too considerate, Miss Marie ! I don't find it as easy as you do to give people a slap in the face. And, as you see, I have the courage to come and see you, just as you have the courage to receive me.*</p>

      <p>There was an intentional double meaning in his words; he wanted to see whether she had taken his story seriously.</p>

      <p>*Did you think I should be afraid of you?' she asked, digging her needle into the material.</p>

      <p>'I couldn't tell how you would receive my explanations, although I felt convinced that yon wouldn't be inconsolable.'</p>

      <p>The word inconsolable irritated her; it seemed to hint at the youthful consoler. But neither of them was inclined to give away the game, Borg was afraid to appear jealous; Marie wondered whether he had seen an3^hing.</p>

      <p>Up to the present she had been bending over her work; as she looked up, now, to read her opponent's face, she noticed with amazement</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>the row of orders on the revers of his dress coat.</p>

      <p>*How smart you are !' she said, with childish malice, trying to conceal her envy.</p>

      <p>'I*m going to the dance.*</p>

      <p>The girl winced. Her face was convulsed; Borg felt the reflex of her pain and seized her hand as she jpurst into passionate sobbing. As he stooped down to her, she hid her face on his shoulder; her whole body shook with weeping.</p>

      <p>'Oh, you great baby!' said Borg.</p>

      <p>*I know I'm a baby. Therefore you should be lenient with me,' sobbed the girl.</p>

      <p>'Tell me—^how far should leniency go?'</p>

      <p>'It should be without limits.'</p>

      <p>'Indeed, it shouldn't! There's a quite definite border line, where wilfulness comes very near to crime.'</p>

      <p>'What do you mean ?'</p>

      <p>'You know what I mean! I can see that very plainly,' replied Borg. The spell was broken; she had grown hard, and when she was hard, she was plain.</p>

      <p>'So you are jealous,' she said tauntingly. She was under the impression that she had re-captured him.</p>

      <p>'No; jealousy is either an unjustifiable distrust or a precautionary measure; my fears were well-foimded. Jealousy is therefore not the right word.'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>'And of a boy! A puppy who is so far beneath you,' continued the girl, paying no heed to his explanation.</p>

      <p>*A11 the more disgrace to you!'</p>

      <p>*And so your whole story was untrue?* she remarked, casually, ignoring the disgrace.</p>

      <p>'From beginning to end ! But I didn't want to hurt your mother and disgrace you! Do you realise my delicacy?'</p>

      <p>'Yes, I lealise it! But I don't understand myself.'</p>

      <p>'Tell me what's happened in the past, and I'll help you to an understanding.'</p>

      <p>'In the past ? What do you mean ?'</p>

      <p>'There is a past, then; I always thought so.'</p>

      <p>'You permit yourself insinuations . . ,'</p>

      <p>'As it no longer concerns me who you are or what you have been . . .' He caught sight of the gunner who was coming to fetch him crossing the hill, and interrupted himself. 'I must say good-bye now.'</p>

      <p>'Don't leave me yet,' pleaded the girl, seizing his hand and looking at him with despairing eyes. 'Don't leave me! I don't know what I shall do if you go.'</p>

      <p>'Why torment each other since we must part?'</p>

      <p>'We won't torment each other! You shall stay with me this evening; I will tell you all</p>

      <p>m *</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>you want to know; then you will judge me differently. *</p>

      <p>These words told Borg everything. He no longer doubted he had escaped the misfortune of marrying another man's, or perhaps many men's, mistress. His decision was taken.</p>

      <p>He went to the window and told the gunner he would come later on in his own boat.</p>

      <p>Then he returned to the sofa and tried to re-start the conversation.</p>

      <p>But, relieved of her anxiety, the girl had broken down; she became more and more taciturn and finally relapsed into complete silence. They had nothing to say and were so weighed down by the fear of raising a storm, that they both became depressed and bored.</p>

      <p>Borg looked at the books which were still lying on the table; his eye fell on a volume which bore the name of the assistant.</p>

      <p>'The story of a young girl, I believe. Have you read it?'</p>

      <p>*No, I haven't had time. Is it worth reading?'</p>

      <p>'It's an unusual book; its author is a woman and yet it is sincere.'</p>

      <p>'Indeed ! What is it about ?'</p>

      <p>'It preaches free love. A young savant is engaged to a girl without prejudices. While he is away on an expedition, she gives herself to an artist; later'c she marries her fianc6.'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>^</p>

      <p>282 BY THE OPEN SEA</p>

      <p>'Well, and what does the author say to it?*</p>

      <p>*She laughs, of course.'</p>

      <p>'Disgusting!' said the girl, getting up to fetch a bottle of wine.</p>

      <p>'Why? Love knows of no right of posses-sion. Moreover, the fianc6 was dull, at least in her society, if the book is to be believed/</p>

      <p>'And we, too, are beginning to be dull,' interrupted Marie, filling the glasses.</p>

      <p>'What is there to talk about?' asked the lover, with a cynical smile which could not be misunderstood. 'Come and sit by me.'</p>

      <p>Instead of feeling o£Fended by the brutal tone and coarse gesture with which he accompanied his invitation, the girl looked admiringly at the man whom she had hitherto almost despised on account of his respectful demeanour.</p>

      <p>It had grown dusk. The waning moon threw a path of greenish light on the floor, sharply silhouetting the pot of balsam.</p>

      <p>Through the open window same the muffled sounds of the first waltz. Queen of the Ball, like a reproach, a greeting from a lost paradise, and, perhaps, a suggestion that all was not yet over. In the hope of binding him to her by the memory of supreme happiness, she gave herself to him, and he passionately told his love.</p>

      <h1 id="c17h01">CHAPTER XVII</h1>

      <p>Three days later the Superintendent of Fisheries, who had spent a little time at Dalaro, returned to the East Skerry.</p>

      <p>When he heard that Miss Marie had left for good, he felt inexpressibly relieved; it was as if the atmosphere had become clearer and more rarified.</p>

      <p>As soon as he entered his room, he opened the window and threw himself on the sofa, to smoke a cigarette and recapitulate the events of the last few days.</p>

      <p>When he had torn himself from Marie's arms at midnight, he had climbed into his boat with the satisfaction of a man who has fulfilled a pressing duty. The equilibrium of his soul was re-established. An offence against his rights had been committed in a case where the law gave him no redress. He had been compelled to take the law into his own hand, and he had only acted in accordance with the principles preached by his opponents.</p>

      <p>On board the corvette where he met men to whom he could speak in the language of the</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>cultured, he had felt like a man intoxicated. He discussed scientific subjects with the doctor; no need now to debase his brain-power and talk down; no need to be semi-idiotic to make his meaning plain; insinuations and nuances were understood at once.</p>

      <p>He realised that for the last three months he had lived in a state of barbarism which had involved him gradually and imperceptibly in petty quarrels; had made his intellectual life second to his sexual and emotional life; had raised retribution to a matter of prime importance and beguiled him into a breeding-competition in which he had won the prize. Now he understood why the representatives of the Christian church, who carry civilisation to savage tribes, are not permitted to found a family, bind themselves to wife and children. He realised that there was virtue in fasting and resignation whenever men desired to live a higher, spiritual life. It was not for the sake of peace that the hermit sought solitude. Just as a single grain of wheat, accidentally fallen on fallow land, may shoot out into sixty ears, while a grain sown in a ploughed field, surrounded by a million others, will only yield two, so also an individual, striving to reach a higher development, can only thrive in the desert.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>The experiences of the last three days proved this. Dragged from circle to circle, both on the corvette and at Dalaro, he noticed night after night, as he went to bed, that his comers were fast being rubbed off. Like a diamond, he gained in appearance, but lost in weight. He had been compelled to make so many cowardly concessions, called forth by a general sympathy with all mankind and the instinct of adaptation, that the views then improvised by him on the spur of the moment, now obtruded themselves upon his memory, claiming to be his inmost thoughts. On the third day, weary of it all, he had looked upon himself as a humbug, saying one thing and thinking another. He was ashamed of himself; he lost his self-respect in the same degree as he gained the respect of his fellow-men, who were delighted at his affability.</p>

      <p>If he wanted to avoid sinking, he must isolate himself; the solitude now regained affected his spirit like a vapour bath or a swim in the sea; he was free from pressure; contact with concrete matter had ceased.</p>

      <p>He resolved to remain on the skerry during the winter.</p>

      <p>His decision taken, he rented the cottage in which Marie and her mother had spent the summer^ and immediately began to remove his</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>things. He converted the larger of the rooms into his study and laboratory, the other one into his dining- and drawing-room; he would sleep in the attic.</p>

      <p>When he awoke on the following morning after a dreamless sleep, he found comfort in the idea that he was inhabiting a whole house by himself. No further risk of suggestions forced on him by the voices of strangers, no further danger of receiving impressions other than those of his own seeking.</p>

      <p>He breakfasted and went into his study after having given orders that nobody was to be admitted before three o'clock.</p>

      <p>He had plenty of leisure now to carry out a plan of many years' standing; he would study the ethnography of modern Europe without making tedious journeys. On printed circulars, drawn up on behalf of a fictitious firm, he wrote the names and addresses of a number of tradesmen and put them into stamped envelopes.</p>

      <p>He was anxious to collect information, as complete as possible, on the measurement of skulls and bodies, and had calculated that circulars to hat manufacturers, undertakers, shirt-makers and hosiers in the principal towns of Europe would furnish him with the desired knowledge. These circulars contained the re-</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>quest to acquaint him with the sizes mostly in demand at home and abroad.</p>

      <p>A second circular was sent to all the booksellers in the capitals as well as the smaller European towns, begging them to send him photographs of all descriptions, at the highes^^ price, the cost to be collected by the post office. He was also in communication with a man who bought up photographs for the sake of the silver.</p>

      <p>In addition he had thousands of portraits cut out of foreign illustrated magazines.</p>

      <p>This material seemed sufficient to him to start on.</p>

      <p>It was noon when he had finished his work. As he went out he noticed a letter in his letter box. The hand-writing was familiar. When he had made sure that it was from Marie, he laid it unopened on the table while he hastily ate his simple dinner. It was sure to contain something unpleasant, for he had broken his promise to return on the following day to say good-bye to her. Determined to save himself annoyance, he pushed it, unopened, into a drawer.</p>

      <p>When he awoke from his afternoon nap, the fever of industry had cooled down; his thoughts, no longer wandering to the books, were irresistibly attracted to the drawer. He</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>paced the room, battling with himself, a prey to indecision. The drawer seemed to contain a part of her soul. Her spirit was in the room; the white envelope on which the red seal shone like a kiss, was charged with the power of her fascination. He saw her sitting on the sofa, heard her whispered words, felt her eyes glowing in the dusk, and his flesh began to bum.</p>

      <p>'What a fool I was,' he thought, 'to let life's greatest happiness slip out of my hands. Since love is a mutual deception, why not let oneself be deceived ? Nothing for nothing ! And as there is no perfect happiness in the world, why not be content with imperfect happiness?'</p>

      <p>He wished he had crawled to her, lied to her that he was her slave; admitted that she had beaten him in the struggle. He could have sent his rival flying. Alone with her, completely at one, he could have bound her to him so firmly with the bond of habit and interest, that she would never have dreamt of seeking love in the arms of another.</p>

      <p>His heart shrank with fear : the letter might rob him of the last shred of hope. He would not read it. Sitting at his laboratory table, without realising what he was doing, he opened an iron retort, pushed the fateful missive in and lit the blowing-lamp. After a few</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>moments smoke issued from the neck. When it had cleared away he struck a match and held it to the gas. A small bluish-yellow flame shot up and burnt for a few minutes with a sound like the peeping of a bat.</p>

      <p>The spirit of the letter, as an alchemist would have said! Burning paper, producing hydrogen and carbon, just as the burning soul in a living body. Carbon and hydrogen! That was all and everything.</p>

      <p>The flame flickered, dwindled and crept back into the funnel. It was dark in the room. Outside the sky had clouded over. The east wind lashed the waves and hurled them on the shore, sighing and hissing. The gale broke on the comer of the house as a wave breaks on the stem of a ship.</p>

      <p>But above all those mournful sounds could be heard the shrieks of the bell-buoy outside, rhythmical as the recitation of a tragedian; pausing every now and then as if taking breath, or bent on letting the last groan die away completely before giving vent to another. It was a Titan's solo, accompanied by the gale, a gigantic organ, the east wind blowing the bellows.</p>

      <p>The room felt stifling. He put on his overcoat and went out to face the storm; perhaps it would blow away his depression.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>Against his will he was attracted by the light of a lamp in the shop. He walked towards it. As the fishing with, the drift nets had been very profitable, business was unusually brisk. Hidden by the darkness he passed close by the gossiping fishermen without being seen.</p>

      <p>*The assistant has taken the girl from him/ said old Oeman, 'she'll have a man, ^t any rate, instead of a . . .'</p>

      <p>'Certainly he's unlike anybody else,' replied Vestman, the bachelor. 'He's written about a hundred letters to-day, which are to be sent off by post. No one can tell what he's doing and brewing. We'd better keep our eyes open, for we know what people are after when they lock themselves in.'</p>

      <p>'Oh! rubbish!' exclaimed Vestman, the husband. 'Let him brew his own drop, if he likes ! He's no worse than old Soderlund who mashed outside, on the cliflFs, and lost his kettle. It's no affair of ours.'</p>

      <p>'Well, if that were all,' insisted old Oeman, 'he could please himself. But I shan't forgive him for wanting to seize my draw net. And if ever I catch him by the fin, I shall not rest until I've thrown him into the fish-box.'</p>

      <p>'He's a wicked man who doesn't believe in God,' said the preacher in conclusion. 'That's a certain fact.'</p>

      <p>The superintendent had never expected gratitude, but he could not help a feeling of sadness. He was in a desert, surrounded by foes of a very dangerous type, who saw in him a madman or a criminal. They believed him to be distilling spirits to make sixpence a quart; they suspected him of being a poisoner. If any accident were to happen on the island, they would lay the blame on him. How could he venture to seize their illegal draw nets, when they would pay him out by bringing against him a more or less scandalous countercharge? or, what might be even worse, take vengeance into their own hands ?</p>

      <p>They were a dangerous rabble, dangerous as stupidity.</p>

      <p>He knew that he could make friends of them at any moment, by inviting them to a quart of brandy and drinking with them; but he did not entertain the thought for one moment. Their enmity ensured his freedom; their friendship would have dragged him down into their mud. Their hatred would have the effect of a rehomotor, even though there could never be any contact between their spirit and his. Danger had its use; it kept his mind awake and subtle, gave him something to fight against, something on which to whet his strength.</p>

      <p>Moreover, there was less danger for him from the savages out here than from his equals among whom he had moved for a few days; they had far more power to harm him. The ship's doctor had looked at him with startled eyes when he suggested that some means should be found of making use of the enormous masses of free carbon, which are wasted ; in the manufacture of sulphuric acid, instead of importing the expensive saltpetre from Chili, to replace the waste of carbon in the soil. And when he added tliat the smoke from the / chimneys might be utilised, the doctor had . advised him to stay for a little while at a watering place and mix with other men.</p>

      <p>It was better to remain here, in complete solitude, and be regarded by these Red-skins as a madman than to be sentenced to civil death by an infallible court of authorities made up of his peers.</p>

      <p>For some time he wandered about in the darkness, but finally he retraced his foot steps and returned to the cottage. He lit the lamps and candles in both rooms and opened all the doors to get rid of the feeling of being shut in.</p>

      <p>He looked at his watch; it was only eight o'clock. The long evening with the night beyond it frightened him; his brain was too fagged for work, but not tired enough for</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>sleep. The moaning of the wind, the soughing of the waves, the shrieking of the buoy, made him feel nervous. To shut out all auditory suggestions, he placed two little sleep bullets into his ears. They were small steel bullets, bought in Germany, intended to prevent all sounds from penetrating to the brain.</p>

      <p>As soon as he had switched ofiE, perhaps, the most important channel of communication with the outer world, his imagination began to work at high pressure.</p>

      <p>An insane longing to know the contents of the destroj^ed letter seized him with such irresistible force, that he opened the retort and tried to read in the ashes. But the fire had burnt the ink, not a trace of the writing could be seen. Now the coast was clear for all manner of doubts and suppositions. At one moment he was quite certain that he could correctly gauge the contents of the letter from what had gone before; at the next he dismissed the idea, remembering that the girl thought and acted illogically.</p>

      <p>Finally he gave it up and decided to dismiss the matter. But his brain had run away with him and brooded on its own account, grinding down and sifting, until he was worn out. Yet sleep remained as far o£E as ever; and as his brain-fag increased, the baser instincts began to stir.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>Furious because his soul could not sustain the struggle with his frail bodjs he undressed, took a dose of bromide of potassium and went to bed.</p>

      <p>The wild careering of his brain was arrested; his fancies grew dim, unconsciousness gradually stole over him and he sank into a leaden sleep.</p>

      <p>Autumn was far advanced, yet the skerry bore no evidence that the summer was spent; no foliage trees with their changing tints reminded the spectator of the year's decline, and the lichen had only grown more succulent and luxurious as the moisture in the air increased. Heather and crow-berry had burst out afresh; the rain had washed junipers and dwarf-pines, the evergreen trees of the North, and cleansed them from dust.</p>

      <p>As soon as the autumn fishing was over, the strangers had returned to their native islands. Once more silence brooded over the skerry. The shop was closed. The sca£Eolding of the chapel had almost entirely disappeared; the boards had been stolen and used for carpentering and firewood; only the posts were still standing, looking like a group of gallows.</p>

      <p>The preacher rarely mixed with the people; since he had become a total abstainer, he had taken quinine wine in large quantities; he suffered from palpitation and a buzzing in the</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>ears, and during the greater part of the day he slept</p>

      <p>After a month's work Axel Borg had recovered from the wound which his love affair had inflicted on his soul. Iodide of potassium and a low diet had stilled desire, and when the sorrow of solitude overwhelmed him, he found relief in nitrous oxide, which he manufactured himself from nitrate of ammonia. The idea of alcoholic intoxication was abhorrent to him, not merely on account of its vulgarity, but also because he knew that there follows in its wake a greater despondency, and often suicidal mania. In the beginning the curious gas had had a stimulating effect and had made him laugh; but the inane chuckle scattered his great thoughts and ambitions to the wind. He scoffed; but no sooner did he find himself among the scoffers who had laughed at him, than he yearned to rise again above himself; yearned for his sorrow and his pain.</p>

      <p>When his isolation had become so complete that the servant was only allowed to straighten his rooms and bring in his meals while he remained locked up in his attic, memories of the summer began to haunt him. He remembered, without the slightest effort, every word that had been spoken.</p>

      <p>The preacher's pursuit of him on that foggy</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>morning and his appearance on the cliff appeared to him as part of a deep-laid scheme. The man's words about him and his father, Marie's dark utterance that she knew who he was took root and began to grow. He felt sure that there was a secret in his life, known to everybody but himself.</p>

      <p>It was not long before the preacher's presence presented itself to him in the light of an espionage, set on foot by his persecutors.</p>

      <p>In calmer hours he knew that he was wrong. He was well aware that persecutional mania is the first symptom of weakness following on isolation.</p>

      <p>Humanity was a huge electric battery consisting of many elements; the isolated element immediately lost its power. The cylinder with its covering of copper wire became devitalised at the moment the soft iron bar was removed. He was on the point of becoming devitalised because his iron bar had grown hard as steel.</p>

      <p>But this persecutional mania, the result of physical weakness, had produced a re-action. Had he not actually been persecuted from the moment it became evident, at school, that he was a power, the first of a new species, ready to break away from his family and, like a differentiated plant, claim a new name which</p>

      <p>Digitized</p>

      <p>by Google</p>

      <p>would, perhaps, become the name of a whole new family? He had been persecuted, instinctively, by the inferiors from below and the mediocre from above. The latter sat in the assaying-ofl&amp;ce and determined the measure by which greatness should be gauged. They had hated and attacked him just as the yellow thoroughbred from the Canary Islands, escaping from its cage and straying among the siskins in the wood, is attacked on account of its gorgeous plumage which irritates the wild birds.</p>

      <p>Nature, with whom he had always been in close communion, appeared dead to him, now, for the intermediary link, man, was no longer there. The sea which he had worshipped because it had seemed to him the only grand feature of his poor country with its petty summer-villa landscapes, was drawing in, in the same degree as his ego expanded. This blue, turpentine-green, grey circle shut him in like a prison yard; the monotonous little landscape made him suflFer for the same reason that a prisoner's cell is said to torture its occupant : he lacked new impressions. Yet he could not face the idea of going away and leaving it all behind; he was rooted in the soil of his mother-country; in its little impressions, its regimen; he could not be transplanted with</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>his roots. It was the tragedy of the man from the north, expressing itself in his longing for the south.</p>

      <p>He fell into the habit of brooding and inventing plans for connecting Sweden with the mainland. His country was really no more than a group of islands, although Lapland joined it to the Continent in the north. The capital of Denmark should become the centre of the north; an express train, travelling in six hours from Stockhblm to Helsingborg, in connexion with a steamship-service across the Sound of Oere should ensure this. Open ports at Djuro and Nynas in the Stockholm Archipelago, in connection with ice-breakers, should keep trade and navigation alive during the whole year. This would limit the northern hibernation and correct the national fault of unsteadiness for which this long interruption of all activity was usually blamed. The stream of Russian trade with England should flow through Stockholm and Goteborg, realising the dreams of Charles XI and Charles XII of trading with Persia and India via Russia and Sweden.</p>

      <p>Sweden should become a country beloved by tourists, attracting crowds of foreigners. He would make a sea-side town of Stockholm by closing the two mouths of the Malar on the</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC ^—^</p>

      <p>^ _ _J</p>

      <p>North-bridge and the sluice at Stockholm, and by a system of canals guide the lake from the Bay of Strengnas through the Lake of Bofven into the sea near Trosa. This would bring the salt water right into the heart of the capital and have a salutary effect on the town and its inhabitants.</p>

      <p>He thought of the time when Sweden, belonging to the great Catholic church, stood in direct communication with Rome, and was looked upon as a part of Europe, and dreamt of re-introducing the Catholic faith, if it were shown that some form of religion was essential to the great mass of the people. It was the faith of their fore-fathers which they had been compelled by fire and sword to forswear; he thought of its martyrs, Hans Brask, Olaus and Johannes Magnus, Nils Dracke and Ture Jonsson, so shamelessly vilified by history.</p>

      <p>The Catholic faith, our Roman inheritance, the first upholder of the ideal of European citizenship, had marched through Europe like a conquering hero. Bismarck had been beaten in the struggle against the ascendancy of the Catholic church, had gone to Canossa and suggested the Pope as arbitrator, when he could no longer deny that arbitration was preferable to steel-guns. Denmark had built Catholic cathedrals and young Denmark had</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>put its pen into the service of the movement. The Teutonisation of the North and North Germany was a relapse into the barbarism of the period after the slaughters of 1870. Its consequences were the elimination of Latin, hatred of all things French and eflports to suppress French literature; a North-German family policy; a Lutheran inquisition and prisons for heretics; a general lowering of the standard of intelligence.</p>

      <p>Lutherism, this was the enemy! A Teutonic civilisation, a middle-class religion in black trousers, the limitations of sectarianism, particularism, isolation, imprisonment, spiritual death. ^</p>

      <p>No, there should be a united Europe; the people's path lay through Rome; the path of &gt; intelligence through Paris. 1</p>

      <p>The Swedish peasant should again become^ a world-citizen and be delivered from his de-1 graded condition; he should no longer be bereft \ of the glimmer of beauty which the older faith \ offers to the eyes and ears; his divine service ^; should be a song of praise indeed, in the Roman tongue, written by poets and not by compilers of hymn-books. There was no need for him to understand an3rthing but that which would awaken his loftiest conceptions of things he could not yet comprehend. Genuine priests</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>should read high-mass to him, men who devoted their lives to religion and the cure of souls, not men who were farmers and dairy-keepers, played cards and did all sorts of clerical work. Then the peasant's wife would have a spiritual guide to whom she could confide her troubles in the confessional, instead of gossiping about them with the servants in the pastor's kitchen.</p>

      <p>If I^atin were re-introduced, the dissertations of Swedish students could be read by the savants of Europe, and every Swedish scholar would realise his fellowship with the great spiritual community presided over by the pontificate at Paris.</p>

      <p>These and other thoughts he wrote down on</p>

      <p>paper and laid them in his drawer; he was not</p>

      <p>in touch with any newspaper or magazine.</p>

      <p>The press would not print his ideas, least of</p>

      <p>all the patriotic press which *from envy was</p>

      <p>disinclined to listen to any proposals for the</p>

      <p>advancement of the mother-country.'</p>

      <p>I The replies to his circulars had come in and</p>

      <p>! his attic was littered with the material for his</p>

      <p>1 European Ethnography.</p>

      <p>But by this time he had lost all interest in the matter. His soul was seriously sick; he had not the courage to go out; the sight of a human being filled him with repugnance and</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>he fiequently retraced his steps rather than meet anybody. At the same time he felt a longing to hear the sound of his voice, discharge his over-productive brain by contact with a fellow-creature; feel the reaction of his individuality on another being, and have somebody to associate with.</p>

      <p>He had a fleeting thought of buying a dog. But the transplanting of the oflF-shoots of his soul, his emotions, into the body of a brute seemed to him like grafting grapes on thistles. And he had never cared for dogs.</p>

      <p>There was only one man on the skerry to whom he felt in the least attracted; this was • • Vestman, the husband, whose wife had a '^^ lover without his knowing it. He was l^^ honest and intelligent. Axel Borg made friends with him by giving him a salmon line and hook. He had lent him books at the beginning of the summer and taught him to write. But when the fishing season began and navigation was brisk, their ways had separated.</p>

      <p>To induce this man to lay the lines, Borg had concealed the fact that it was a question of salmon; the conservative fisherman would have refused to have an3rthing to do with an enterprise which appeared to him in the light of a senseless waste of effort. He therefore</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>gave him to understand that it was a new method of catching cod, a method by which the very largest fish could be caught.</p>

      <p>As Axel Borg was rowing out to sea with Vestman after his isolation of a whole month, and listened to the sound of his voice, it struck him that it was less resonant, and had changed its timbre from want of use. It seemed to be the voice of a stranger. Talking threw him into a state of ecstasy. His brain whose only medium of expression had been the pen, burst through the flood-gates of his larynx; his thoughts gushed forth like a waterfall, giving birth to new thoughts on their way.</p>

      <p>Allowed to pour out his ideas, with a human ear as a sounding board, without interruption, without bemg asked a single question, he imagined that he had found an intelligent listener. After their first expedition he was convinced that Vestman was the most intelligent man he had come across for a long time.</p>

      <p>Their intercourse lasted for one week. He initiated the fisherman into the secrets of nature; explained the eflfect of the moon on the surface of the sea; warned him not to believe that things are what they appear to be. He told him that the moon was pear-shaped, although she had the appearance of being round; he said that it was not absolutely proved that the earth was round . . .</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>Vestman pulled a face and for the first time ventured a remark: *But it says so in the almanack!'</p>

      <p>Borg saw that he had gone too far, and that it was time to turn back; but it was too late. He could not talk to Vestman of the more recent discoveriesj according to which the shape of the earth is an ellipsoid with three axes; it required knowledge which Vestman did not possess. He changed his subject. He talked of mirages and asked him whether anybody had been to the Swordholm and seen the havoc he had made.</p>

      <p>*0h! yes/ replied Vestman, *we know that somebody's been there; but nobody lands there now, and fishing and sheep-farming has been abandoned.'</p>

      <p>After this confession Borg shut himself up again, ashamed of having become the victim of a delusion, ashamed of having believed that the fisherman had understood what he had told him. He had been speaking against a wall, and had taken the echo for another man's voice.</p>

      <p>A week later there was tremendous excitement on the skerry. Vestman had caught a salmon, weighing twenty-six pounds.</p>

      <p>As he considered himself the inventor of the new industry, a paragraph soon appeared in u</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>the newspaper. A new industry for the Stockholm Archipelago had been discovered since the stromming had been on the decline. The lucky fisherman, Eric Vestman, a customs oflficial, deserved the respect and gratitude of his fellow citizens . . .</p>

      <p>Shortly after a weekly publication for the people brought a venomous attack on Superintendents of Fisheries who know nothing, but think they can teach everybody • . .</p>

      <p>It was followed by a letter from the Agricultural College, requesting Superintendent Borg to furnish more detailed reports on the fishing industry; more especially on the salmon fishery.</p>

      <p>Borg replied by sending in his resignation.</p>
    </section>

    <section epub:type="chapter" id="c19">

      <p>Now that he was no longer of any importance in the eyes of the people and had lost what little support his official position had given him, Axel Borg soon became aware that the natives, convinced that he had been turned out, were firmly resolved to drive him away from the skerry.</p>

      <p>They began hostilities by mimooring his boat from the landing stage under the pretext that there was not sufficient room; the boat was thrown on the shore and broken to pieces.</p>

      <p>On the next rainy day he noticed that the rain came through the ceiling of his attic. He complained of it to Oeman with the result that the rain penetrated into the other rooms as well, although there was not a tile missing.</p>

      <p>A little later on burglars broke into his cellar. The blame was laid on some men from Bsthland.</p>

      <p>The intention of driving him away was unmistakable, but he determined to defy his foes. The only way of doing this was by ceasing to</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>complain and bearing the outrages with apparent indiflEerence.</p>

      <p>He really was surrounded by enemies now and as he had cut himself adrift from the society of his equals he fell a victim to the fear of the outcast.</p>

      <p>He slept badly in spite of all his attempts to regulate his dreams by strong auto-suggestions before falling asleep. Sometimes he awoke from a dream that he was a bell-buoy, drifting and drifting in search of a shore on which he could be thrown. And in his sleep he had pressed close against the bedstead, so as to feel the contact of some object, even if it were an inanimate one.</p>

      <p>Sometimes he was hovering in mid-air, unable to rise or fall. Once, as he came round from a fainting fit, he found himself clutching the pillow with both his hands.</p>

      <p>Memories of his dead mother haunted him; vhe mother, origin and link between conscious and unconscious life, mediator and consoler. He often dreamt that he was again a little baby, sleeping in her arms. Childish thoughts of meeting her again in another life filled his mind. His first thoughts of suicide were suggested by his longing to find her somewhere, in another world, in which he did not believe.</p>

      <p>Science was powerless to help a moribund spirit which had lost all interest in life. His brain had fought until it was tired out. His imagination worked without a regulator.</p>

      <p>He was still about when Christmas approached, but he ate little and took ether at night. He loathed life and smiled at his former ambitions. The rain had spoilt his books and papers; his instruments were covered with rust and verdigris.</p>

      <p>He had ceased caring for his personal appearance; his beard was untrimmed; his hair matted; he disliked water; his linen had not been washed for a long time; he had no eye for uncleanliness. Buttons were missing on his clothes; his waistcoat was spotted with grease; the hand which guided knife and fork no longer obeyed his will.</p>

      <p>When he went into the street the children made fun of him and called him names.</p>

      <p>One morning he was again surrounded by a little tribe of children. They pulled his coat. When he turned round, one of them flung a stone which hit his chin so violently that blood began to flow. He burst into tears and begged them not to be unkind to him.</p>

      <p>'Time you kicked the bucket, you crazy devil,' shouted a boy of twelve. 'We don't want to have to keep you !*</p>

      <p>And all of them began to throw stones at him. But Oeman's servant rushed out of the cottage and seized the boy by the hair. When she had chastised him she turned to the victim and with her apron wiped the blood from his face.</p>

      <p>'Poor little gentleman/ she said.</p>

      <p>He laid his head on her ample bosom.</p>

      <p>*I/et me stay with you,' he faltered.</p>

      <p>The girl pushed him from her. 'Get out!' she said harshly, and went back into the cottage.</p>

      <p>One evening, a few days later, Vestman*s servant came running to his cottage and begged Dr Borg to visit her mistress, who was dying.</p>

      <p>The message was a little unexpected, but with that clear-sightedness which distinguished his illness at saner moments, he suspected foul play, and the intention to make use of his name and title to avoid a post mortem examination. The matter was indifferent to him, but it roused him for the moment. Something had happened; the unusual had made an impression on his mind.</p>

      <p>He went to the custom house and was received by the two brothers with a suspicious politeness. But he said nothing; asked no questions; he wanted to compel the man to</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>confess by forcing him to open the conversation, convinced that the first sentence wonld give him away.</p>

      <p>The little girl was silently eating a piece of saffron bread by the light of a tallow candle.</p>

      <p>She was dressed in her Sunday clothes probably to make her feel solemn and keep her quiet.</p>

      <p>After Borg had looked round the room and noticed that Vestman's brother had crept away, he went to the bed on which the dead woman lay.</p>

      <p>He saw at once that she was dead. He could tell from the contracted muscles of her face that she had died by violence. When he saw that her hair was carefully combed across the parting, he had no doubt that the good old method of the nail had been chosen.</p>

      <p>But he was determined to make Vestman speak first; he turned to him with half-open lips and eloquent eyes, apparently on the point of asking a question. Vestman allowed him-self to be deceived and believing that he was speaking to a madman, with whom he need not be very much on his guard, he said :</p>

      <p>*You might certify, doctor, that she is dead, then we could bury her straight away; no need to tell you that poor people like we can't afford to send for a doctor.*</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQ IC</p>

      <p>Borg had heard enough. He looked at Vestman, who was now perfectly calm, and whispered:</p>

      <p>'Where's the hammer?'</p>

      <p>\^estman took a step or two back, as if he meant to throw himself upon his opponent and strangle him. Borg disarmed him by a look at the child. The man stood before him, shaking.</p>

      <p>'He has no idea where the hammer is, but I know where the nail can be found, * continued Borg, imperturbably. 'Oh ! you self-sufficent donkeys who cannot invent anything new but, like children, always hide in the same spot when they play hide and seek. Surely this nailing of the brain was invented in the Middle-Ages by a priest or a nobleman and has only now reached the lower classes, instead of being, as is always stated, a proof of their cunning. Everything comes from those above : salmon, arsenic, nail, gun-shots, revolutions, national freedom, wealth, folklore, dialect, peasants' intrigues, anthropological museums. But only by theft; you mob, you'd rather steal than take a gift, for you are too petty to say thank you. Therefore you drive your benefactors into the madhouses and your noblemen to the scaflFold. Take me to an asylum now, it will save you from prison.'</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>When he had gone back to his cottage, he realised that the pleasure of speaking his mind to Vestman had made him commit an indiscretion. He knew the i)eople's character and was well aware that fear for his own safety might induce the murderer to silence a dangerous witness. Henceforth he slept with his revolver by his bedside and his sleep was troubled by evil dreams.</p>

      <p>On the following day he remained at home; he noticed white sheets hanging before the windows of the custom house.</p>

      <p>On the third day the body was brought out and carried into a boat.</p>

      <p>On the fourth the men returned to the skerry.</p>

      <p>After that Borg slept no more, and insomnia completed the work of destruction. Diead of insanity and confinement in a lunatic asylum, and the fear of being murdered, strengthened his resolution to put an end to his life. n</p>

      <p>And now that he was contemplating death, \ and the close of a life, the extinction of a family, perhaps, was at hand, his sexual instinct awoke, manifesting itself in the passionate desire for a child.</p>

      <p>He tried to satisfy this longing by scientific experiments. Once, for a brief moment, a flash of hope lit up the gloom which sur-</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>rounded him. But it was followed by complete failure. Magnified by his sick soul, his pain grew into mourning, mourning for his dead hope. There was now no bond between this life and the next. He had no strength to begin afresh. Half-delirious, he imagined himself a wrecked vessel, tossed on the waves, between air and water, until at last he felt the jerk of the anchor chain and had a feeling of stability, as if his connexion with the solid earth had been re-established.</p>

      <p>Strong warm fingers gripped his right hand. He pressed them without looking up, merely for the sake of feeling himself in touch with a living soul. He seemed to be conscious of an inpouring of strength, as the weaker nerve-current was connected with the stronger.</p>

      <p>'What's the matter ?' It was the preacher's voice, talking somewhere above his head.</p>

      <p>'If you were a woman, life would still be possible to me, for the woman is the man's root in the earth,' replied the sick man, for the first time talking familiarly to his old schoolfellow.</p>

      <p>'Congratulate yourself for having got rid of the foul root!'</p>

      <p>'Without root we cannot grow and blossom !'</p>

      <p>'But with such a woman, Borg!'</p>

      <p>'Such a woman? Do you know who she was? I never knew.*</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>*Then yon need only know that she was the sort a man doesn't marry. Bnt she's engaged again . . .'</p>

      <p>'To him?'</p>

      <p>'To him. I read it in the paper, yesterday.'</p>

      <p>After a moment's silence, the preacher rose to go, bnt the sick man held him back.</p>

      <p>'Tell me a fairy tale,' he begged, childishly imploring him.</p>

      <p>'A fairytale?'</p>

      <p>'Yes, a fairy tale. Tell me about Tom Thumb. Do, please.'</p>

      <p>The preacher sat down again, and when he saw that Borg was serious, he humoured him.</p>

      <p>The sick man listened attentively and when the preacher, according to his habit, tried to point a moral,'he interrupted him and begged him to keep to his story.</p>

      <p>'It does one good to hear the old fairy tales again! It's like taking a rest; like diving into the sweetest memories of a time when one was a little animal and loved the useless and the senseless. Now repeat to me the Lord's prayer!'</p>

      <p>'You have no faith in the Lord's prayer!'</p>

      <p>'No more than in the fairy tales. But it does one good in the same way. When death approaches and one is slipping down, one loves old things and becomes conservative. Repeat</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>^</p>

      <p>316 BY THE OPEN SEA</p>

      <p>the Lord's prayer and you shall be my heir; I will destroy your promissory note if you will pray/</p>

      <p>The preacher hesitated for a moment, but finally he began to pray.</p>

      <p>At first the sick man listened silently; then his lips moved inaudibly, and finally he pronounced the words with the intonation of a man who is praying.</p>

      <p>'It is good to pray, I believe,' said the preacher, after the prayer had come to an end.</p>

      <p>*It*s like medicine. The old words awaken memories and strengthen the heart, just as they used to strengthen the heart of the self-unconscious man, who sought God outside himself. Do you know what God is ? He is the fixed point for which Archimedes longed, on which to build up the earth. He is the magnet in the earth which we postulate, because without it the movements of the magnetic needle would be inexplicable. He is the ether which we had to invent to fill empty space. He is the molecule without which the chemical laws would be a miracle. Give me more hypotheses, above everything else give me the fixed point outside myself, for I am cut quite adrift.'</p>

      <p>'Shall I speak to you of our Lord Jesus ?• asked the preacher, imagining that Borg was delirious.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>*No! Not of Jesus! He is neither a fairy tale nor a hypothesis. He is an invention of revengeful slaves and evil women; he is the god of the invertebrate, as opposed to the god of the vertebrate . . . but—^let me see, I am one of the invertebrate. Speak of Jesus! who associated with publicans and loose women as I have had to do; who said that the poor in spirit should inherit the kingdom of heaven, because they can't govern the earth; who taught artisans to be idle, and beggars, loafers and wastrels, who possess nothing, to share all things with the industrious ! *</p>

      <p>'Blasphemer, I'm not your fool!' interrupted the preacher, rising from his chair.</p>

      <p>'Don't go! Don't go!' exclaimed the sick man. 'Hold my hand, let me hear your voice. Talk to me of anything you like! Read to me from the almanack or the bible, I don't care which! Only drive away the horror vacui, the fear of the empty void 1'</p>

      <p>*Do vou admit, then, that you are afraid of death?'</p>

      <p>'Yes, I am, as all things living which, without this fear, would never have lived! But I'm not afraid of the judgment. The work judges the master; I have not made myself!'</p>

      <p>But the preacher had gone.</p>

      <p>It was Christmas Eve. After a stormy night during which he had heard shots and shouts and screams from human voices, Borg was taking a stroll in the newly fallen snow. The sky was blue-black like sheet iron; the breakers flung themselves on to the shore, and the bell-buoy screamed incessantly, as if it were shouting for assistance.</p>

      <p>A large, black steamer, whose scarlet bottom shone like a bleeding lacerated breast, was lying south-east. The funnel with its white ring was broken and lay on one side. Dark figures clung to masts and yards, writhing like earth-worms on a fishing hook. The waves were washing parcels, bales, wooden and cardboard boxes from a cleft in the centre of the boat; the heavier ones sank to the bottom, but the lighter ones were tossed on the shore.</p>

      <p>Indifferent to the fate of the shipwrecks, like a man who looks upon death as a boon, he wandered along the shore and came to the headland with a pile of stones surmounted by</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>the cross. Here the sea was more turbulent than in any other spot, and the green waves dandled and tossed objects of strange shape and colour, above which the sea-gulls sci earned furiously, as if disappointed in their greedy anticipation of prey.</p>

      <p>As he gazed at the strange shapes which floated nearer and nearer, it struck him that they were little, well-dressed children. Some of them had fair curls, others were dark; their cheeks were pink and white; their wide-open eyes stared at the black sky, immovable and without blinking. When they came closer to the shore, he saw that the eyes of some of them moved when the waves rocked them, as if they were making him signs to save them. The next breaker flung five of them on the shore.</p>

      <p>The craving for a child was so firmly rooted in his soft brain, that it never occured to him that the little shipwrecks were dolls on their way to the Christmas fair, when disaster had overtaken the belated vessel. He gathered his little foundlings, given to him by the great mother, the sea, into his arms» and pressing them to his breast, ran back to his cottage to dry them.</p>

      <p>But he had nothing with which to make a fire, for the natives had refused to sell him wood. He did not feel the cold, but he was</p>

      <p>Digitized by GoOglC ^^^</p>

      <p>determined that his little Christmas guests should be warm. He broke up his bookshelves, made a blazing fire in the large fireplace, pushed the sofa close to it and sat the little ones in a row before the flames.</p>

      <p>When the idea occured to him that they could not get dry unless he undressed them, he began to take off their wet clothes; but realising that they were girls, he left them their little chemises.</p>

      <p>Then he washed their hands and feet with his sponge, combed their hair, re-dressed them, and put them to sleep.</p>

      <p>It was as if he had visitors. He walked about on tip-toe for fear of waking them.</p>

      <p>He had something for which he could live; something for which he could care, which he could love.</p>

      <p>He went back to the sofa to look at the sleeping children; he noticed that their eyes were open; he thought that the light prevented them from falling asleep and pulled down the blinds.</p>

      <p>The room was almost dark; an irresistible drowsiness overcame him. It was caused by hunger, but he was no longer able to localise the cause of his sensations; he could not tell whether he was hungry or thirsty.</p>

      <p>As the sofa was taken up by the children, he lay down on the floor and soon fell asleep.</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>It was quite dark in the room when he awoke, but the door was wide open and a woman with a lighted lantern stood on the threshold.</p>

      <p>*The Lord have mercy upon us! He's lying on the floor!' exclaimed Oeman's servant. 'Don't you know that it's Christmas day, sir?'</p>

      <p>He had slept for over twenty four hours, until the afternoon of the next day.</p>

      <p>He arose, dazed. He missed something; the customs officials had been and claimed the wreckage, but he could not remember what it was he missed. He was only conscious of a terrible blank, a great mourning.</p>

      <p>* You must come to Oeman's and eat Christmas pudding; we're all Christians at Christmas time. Oh, dear, oh, dear; what misery!'</p>

      <p>And the girl began to cry.</p>

      <p>'To see a Christian go down like that; it's enough to make one weep tears of blood! Come with me, sir! Come along with me!' Borg motioned her to go, giving her to understand that he would follow.</p>

      <p>When she had gone, he remained in his room for a few more minutes, took the lantern which she had left on the floor, and looked into the glass.</p>

      <p>When he saw his face looking like the face</p>

      <p>Digitized by Google ^</p>

      <p>of a savage, a light seemed to dawn on him, and he pulled himself together for a last effort.</p>

      <p>Leaving the lantern on the floor, he went out.</p>

      <p>The wind had veered to the west and had gone down a little; the atmosphere was clear and the stars glittered in the deep-blue sky.</p>

      <p>Guided by the lights in the cottage windows, he went down to the harbour, stole into a sea-booth and brought out some sails.</p>

      <p>He hoisted them, unmoored the boat, sat down at the helm, and a wind blowing from the stem drove him straight out to sea.</p>

      <p>He cruised for a little while; he wanted to have a last look at the place where he had suffered so much. But when he saw the candles in a three-armed candlestick burning in the window of the custom-house, where the murderer celebrated the birth of Christ, the forgiver of sins, the idol of all weaklings and criminals, behind whom all the evil formerly punished by the civil code sheltered, he turned away, spat, and took full advantage of the wind.</p>

      <p>With his back to the land he sailed below the starry sky, steering a course to a star of the second magnitude, between the L3n:e and the Corona, in the east. It seemed to him to shine more brilliantly than the rest. A vague</p>

      <p>Digitized by VjOOQIC</p>

      <p>memory of the star of Bethelem stirred his mind; a dim recollection of a pilgrimage of three dethroned kings, three fallen stars, journeying to Bethlehem, to worship their own smallness in the humblest of all beings, who eventually became the chosen god of all those who were small and of no account.</p>

      <p>No, this could not be his star, for the Christian magicians had brought darkness to the earth, and as a punishment there was not a single point of light in the heavens which bore their name. Therefore they celebrated the darkest season—how sublimely ridiculous—^by lighting wax candles.</p>

      <p>Suddenly a ray of light illuminated his darkened memory. It was the star Beta in the constellation Hercules!</p>

      <p>Hercules, the moral ideal of the Greek, the god of strength and wisdom, who killed the Lernaean hydra with its hundred heads, cleansed the stables of Augias, caught the man-eating mares of Diomedes, robbed the Queen of the Amazons of her belt, and brought Cerberus from the gates of hell, finally to perish through the stupidity of a woman who, from sheer love, poisoned him, after he had served Omphale, the nymph, for three years, insane . . .</p>

      <p>Away, to meet him, whom the gods had</p>

      <p>Digitized by Google ^</p>

      <p>received into Olympus, who had never permitted himself to be flogged and spat at without retaliating. Away, to meet him who had burnt himself to death, who could only fall by his own strong hand, and who had never prayed for mercy. Away, to meet Hercules, who had released the light-bringer, Prometheus, who was the son of a god and a human mother, perverted by his savage detractors into the child of a virgin, adored at his birth by milk-drinking shepherds and neighing donkeys.</p>

      <p>Away, towards the new Christmas star, across the sea, the All-mother, in whose lap was kindled the first spark of life; the inexhaustible bourne of fertility and love, the origin of life and its foe.</p>
